Introduction to Bytes Objects in Python 3.10

Bytes objects in Python 3.10 are immutable sequences of single bytes. They are also known as "byte strings" or "binary strings". In simpler terms, they represent sequences of bytes that are treated like strings of characters. In this guide, we will learn about the basics of using bytes objects in Python 3.10.

1. Creating Bytes Objects
To create a bytes object, we can use the built-in function bytes(). The bytes() function takes an iterable of integers between 0 and 256 and returns a bytes object containing those integers.

For example, let us create a bytes object containing the ASCII codes for the string "hello" –

```
hello_bytes = bytes([104, 101, 108, 108, 111])
print(hello_bytes)
```
Output:

```
b'hello'
```

Note that the ‘b’ before the string denotes that it is a bytes object.

Alternatively, we can also create a bytes object by encoding a string using the ‘utf-8’ encoding. Here’s how we can do it –

```
hello_bytes = "hello".encode("utf-8")
print(hello_bytes)
```
Output:

```
b'hello'
```

2. Accessing the Bytes Object
As mentioned earlier, a bytes object is a sequence of bytes. We can access the individual bytes in the object using an index. For example –

```
hello_bytes = bytes([104, 101, 108, 108, 111])
print(hello_bytes[0])
print(hello_bytes[1])
```

Output:
```
104
101
```

3. Converting to String
Although bytes objects are not string objects, we can convert them to a string using the ‘utf-8’ encoding. We can use the decode() method to convert from bytes object to string.

```
hello_bytes = bytes([104, 101, 108, 108, 111])
hello_str = hello_bytes.decode("utf-8")
print(hello_str)
```
Output:

```
hello
```

4. Comparing Bytes Objects
Comparing bytes objects in Python can be done using the standard comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=). When two bytes objects are compared, they are supposed to be of equal length.

```
a = bytes([1, 2, 3])
b = bytes([1, 2, 4])
print(a == b)
```

Output:

```
False
```

In the above example, the output is false since the two bytes objects are not equal.

5. Concatenating Bytes
We can concatenate bytes objects using the + operator. Here’s an example –

```
a = bytes([1, 2, 3])
b = bytes([4, 5, 6])
c = a + b
print(c)
```

Output:

```
b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06'
```

6. Modifying Bytes Objects
As mentioned earlier, bytes objects are immutable. This means that once created, the contents of the bytes object cannot be changed. However, we can create a new bytes object with a modified version of the original bytes object.

```
a = bytes([104, 101, 108, 108, 111])
a_modified = a[:3] + bytes([112, 113])
print(a_modified)
```

Output:

```
b'helpq'
```

In the above example, we created a new bytes object by taking the first three bytes of the original bytes object and concatenating them with ‘pq’.

Conclusion

In this guide, we have learned the basics of bytes objects in Python 3.10. We have learnt how to create, access, convert to a string, compare, concatenate and modify bytes objects. These are some of the most important aspects of using bytes objects in Python 3.10.
