numbers including integers, floats, doubles, int16, int23, float16, etc.
========================================================================
Introduction:

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. One of the major reasons behind its popularity is that it makes use of numbers which is an essential element of almost any programming language. Numbers in python can be of several types such as integers, floats, doubles, etc. Understanding these types of numbers and how to use them is a fundamental requirement in python programming.

In this course, we will be discussing how to use numbers in python version 3.10. We will go through the basic concepts and syntax for working with integers, floats, doubles, int16, int23, float16, etc. in python.

What are Numbers in Python?

Numbers in python refer to the numeric data types that we can use to represent any mathematical values. The most common types of numbers in python include integers, floats, doubles, etc. Each type of number has its own unique properties and uses in programming.

Integers:

Integers are the most basic type of numbers in python. These are the whole numbers with no decimal points. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. In python, we use the "int" keyword to declare an integer. Here is an example:

num = 5
print(num)

Floats:

Floats are the numbers with decimal points. These are used when we need a more precise value than integers. For example, 1.5, 2.8, 3.14, etc. In python, we use the "float" keyword to declare a float value. Here is an example:

num = 3.14
print(num)

Doubles:

Doubles are similar to floats in terms of the decimal points. However, doubles have better precision than floats. In python, there is no keyword for declaring a double value. Instead, we can use the "float" keyword, and python will automatically assign it as a double. Here is an example:

num = 3.14159265359
print(num)

Int16:

Int16 is a numeric data type in python that can store values between -32768 and 32767. We use the "int16" function to declare an int16 value. Here is an example:

num = int16(32767)
print(num)

Int32:

Int32 is a numeric data type in python that can store values between -2147483648 and 2147483647. We use the "int32" function to declare an int32 value. Here is an example:

num = int32(2147483647)
print(num)

Float16:

Float16 is a numeric data type in python that is used for machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It can store a decimal value with a precision of 3.8 bits. We use the "float16" function to declare a float16 value. Here is an example:

num = float16(3.14)
print(num)

Summary:

Numbers are essential for performing mathematical operations in python. Understanding the different types of numbers in python is important to use the most appropriate type for the task at hand. This course discussed the basic concepts and syntax for using integers, floats, doubles, int16, int23, float16, etc. in python version 3.10.
