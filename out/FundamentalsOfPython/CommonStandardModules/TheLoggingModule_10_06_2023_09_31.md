the logging module
==================
The logging module in Python is a useful tool for tracking and debugging code errors and events. This article will provide a beginner-level course on using the logging module in Python version 3.10. Follow the steps below to get started.

1. Import the logging module
The first step is to import the logging module to your code. You can do this by adding the following line to your code:

```
import logging
```

2. Set up logging configuration
Before logging anything in your code, you need to set up the logging configuration. Here’s an example of how to do that:

```
logging.basicConfig(filename="example.log", level=logging.DEBUG, filemode="w")
```

The above code will set the logging level to DEBUG and create a file named example.log in write mode (filemode=”w”).

3. Log messages
Now you’re ready to log messages in your code. You can use one of the following methods:

- debug(message): Use this method to log detailed information that can be used to debug your code.
```
logging.debug("This is a debug message")
```

- info(message): Use this method to log general information about your code.
```
logging.info("This is an information message")
```

- warning(message): Use this method to log a warning message when some unexpected behavior occurs.
```
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
```

- error(message): Use this method to log an error message when your code encounters an error.
```
logging.error("This is an error message")
```

- critical(message): Use this method to log a critical message when a fatal error occurs in the code.
```
logging.critical("This is a critical message")
```

4. Define custom loggers
You can define custom loggers with specific logging levels using the following code:

```
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

In this example, we’re defining a logger with a level of INFO. The logger is named after the name of the current module (__name__).

5. Use custom loggers
After defining custom loggers, you can use them to log messages in your code:

```
logger.info('This is a custom info message')
```

6. Using formatting
You can format the log messages to include more information, like the current file, line number, and function name:

```
logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(module)s %(funcName)s() %(message)s', filename='example.log', level=logging.DEBUG, filemode='w')
```

Here’s a breakdown of the format string:

- %(asctime)s: The current date and time.
- %(levelname)s: The logging level.
- %(module)s: The current module name.
- %(funcName)s: The current function name.
- %(message)s: The log message.

7. Conclusion
In conclusion, the logging module in Python version 3.10 is a useful tool for tracking and debugging code errors and events. By using the steps outlined above, you can set up logging in your code and get started with logging messages of varying levels of severity.
