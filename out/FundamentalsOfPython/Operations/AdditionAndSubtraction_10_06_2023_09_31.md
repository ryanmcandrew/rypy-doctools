addition and subtraction
========================
Welcome to the How to Course on Using Addition and Subtraction in Python Version 3.10! In this course, we will guide you through the basics of using addition and subtraction in Python.

Python is a powerful programming language that has become one of the most popular languages in the world. It is often used for data analysis and machine learning, but can also be used for simple arithmetic calculations. Let’s get started with how to use addition and subtraction.

We will begin by opening up the Python interpreter by typing “python” in the terminal, then press enter.

Addition:

1. To add two numbers, use the plus sign (+).
2. Type the first number followed by the plus sign, then the second number. Example: `2+5`.
3. Press enter and the sum will be displayed in the terminal.

```python
>>> 2+5
7
```

4. You can also add more than two numbers by separating them by commas. Example: `2+5+8+3`.
5. Press enter and the sum will be displayed in the terminal.

```python
>>> 2+5+8+3
18
```

Subtraction:

1. To subtract two numbers, use the minus sign (-).
2. Type the first number followed by the minus sign, then the second number. Example: `10-3`.
3. Press enter and the difference will be displayed in the terminal.

```python
>>> 10-3
7
```

4. You can also subtract more than two numbers by separating them by commas. Example: `15-3-1-4`.
5. Press enter and the difference will be displayed in the terminal.

```python
>>> 15-3-1-4
7
```

That’s it! You now know how to perform basic arithmetic calculations in Python. You can use these skills to do more advanced calculations, such as multiplication and division, or apply your knowledge to create programs that perform complex calculations.
