function parameters
===================
Introduction:

Function parameters are an essential part of Python coding as they help us pass data from one function to another. In Python 3.10, there are two types of function parameters that you can use: positional parameters and keyword parameters. 

In this how-to course, we will cover the basics of using function parameters in Python 3.10. We will start by explaining what function parameters are and why they are important. We will then move on to the two types of parameters - positional and keyword parameters. Finally, we will provide some examples to demonstrate how function parameters can be used in real-world coding scenarios.

Prerequisites:

Before you begin, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming concepts, including functions, variables, and data types. You should also have Python 3.10 installed on your computer.

Part 1: What are function parameters?

Function parameters are the inputs that a function receives when it is called. They are the values that are passed as arguments to the function. Function parameters can be used to make a function more versatile and customizable. They enable a function to accept different types of data, and they can be used to modify the behavior of a function by changing its arguments.

Part 2: Positional Parameters

Positional parameters are the most common type of function parameter used in Python. They are simply a list of arguments that are passed to a function in the order that they are specified. The positional parameters are specified inside the parentheses of the function definition.

For example, here is a basic function that takes two numbers as inputs and returns their sum:

```
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    result = num1 + num2
    return result
```

In this example, `num1` and `num2` are the positional parameters. When this function is called, it expects two values to be passed in the order that they are defined.

Here is how you can call this function:

```
>>> add_numbers(5, 10)
15
```

In this example, `5` is passed as the value of `num1`, and `10` is passed as the value of `num2`. The function then returns the sum of those two numbers, which is `15`.

Part 3: Keyword Parameters

Keyword parameters allow you to specify the argument name along with the value. This can be useful when you have a function with many arguments, or when you want to pass optional arguments to the function.

To use keyword parameters, simply specify the argument name followed by the value in the function call. For example:

```
def add_numbers(num1, num2, num3=0):
    result = num1 + num2 + num3
    return result
```

In this example, `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` are the keyword parameters. `num3` has a default value of `0`, which means that it is an optional argument.

Here is how you can call this function using keyword parameters:

```
>>> add_numbers(num1=5, num2=10, num3=15)
30
```

In this example, the `num1` parameter is set to `5`, the `num2` parameter is set to `10`, and the `num3` parameter is set to `15`. Since all three parameters are passed as keyword arguments, their order does not matter.

If you want to call this function using both positional and keyword parameters, you can do so like this:

```
>>> add_numbers(5, num3=15, num2=10)
30
```

In this example, `5` and `10` are passed as positional parameters, while `15` is passed as a keyword parameter.

Part 4: Examples

Here are some practical examples of how function parameters can be used in real-world coding scenarios:

Example 1: Calculating the area of a circle

```
def calculate_area(radius):
    pi = 3.14159
    area = pi * (radius ** 2)
    return area
```

In this example, `radius` is the positional parameter. When this function is called, it expects the radius of the circle to be passed as an argument.

```
>>> calculate_area(10)
314.159
```

In this example, `calculate_area` is called with a radius of `10`. The function then calculates the area of the circle with that radius and returns the result.

Example 2: Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius

```
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_f):
    temp_c = (temp_f - 32) * 5/9
    return temp_c
```

In this example, `temp_f` is the positional parameter. This function takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius.

```
>>> fahrenheit_to_celsius(68)
20.0
```

In this example, `fahrenheit_to_celsius` is called with a temperature of `68` degrees Fahrenheit. The function then converts that temperature to Celsius and returns the result.

Conclusion:

Using function parameters is an essential part of Python programming. They allow you to create more versatile and customizable functions that can accept different types of data. By using positional and keyword parameters, you can create functions that are more robust and adaptable to different use cases. We hope that this how-to course has helped you understand the basics of using function parameters in Python 3.10.
