function scoping
================
Introduction:

Python is a high-level programming language that offers various features to manage functions within a program. Function scoping is one of the key features in Python 3.10, which helps professionals define and manage functions within a program efficiently. 

This course will guide you through everything you need to know about using function scoping in Python 3.10. It will cover the following topics:

1. Understanding the basics of function scoping in Python 3.10
2. Creating a function using local scope 
3. Creating a function using global scope 
4. Creating a function using nested scope 
5. Using the nonlocal keyword 
6. Conclusion 

By the end of this course, you will be able to apply function scoping in Python 3.10 efficiently to create high-quality programs. 

1. Understanding the basics of function scoping in Python 3.10:

Function scoping refers to the visibility of variables or objects within a function. Python offers various types of scopes like local, global, and nested, to manage variables effectively within a program. In Python 3.10, function scoping allows a programmer to determine the scope of any variable within a function. The program also provides a non-local keyword that helps to access non-local variables within a nested function.

2. Creating a function using local scope:

To define function scoping using local scope, you have to declare a variable within a function, and it will only be accessible within that function. You can define such a function using the following syntax:

```
def local_function():
    variable = "Local Value"
    print(variable)
    
local_function()
```

In the above example, the variable defining is only accessible within the local_function.

3. Creating a function using global scope:

To define a function using the global scope in Python 3.10, you can declare a global variable outside of the function, and it will be accessible throughout the program. Follow the syntax to create a global scope function:

```
global_value = "Global Value"

def global_function():
    print(global_value)
    
global_function()
```

In the above-mentioned example, the global_value is defined globally, and the global_function is accessing the global_value.

4. Creating a function using nested scope:

In Python 3.10, functions can also be defined using the nested scope. A nested scope occurs when a function is defined within another function. You can define such a function using the following syntax:

```
def outer_function():
    outer_value = "Outer Value"
    
    def inner_function():
        inner_value= "Inner Value"
        print(inner_value)
    
    inner_function()
    print(outer_value)
    
outer_function()
```

In the above code, the inner_function is defined inside the outer_function. Therefore, the outer_value will be accessible in both the inner_function and outer_function.

5. Using the nonlocal keyword:

Python 3.10 provides the nonlocal keyword to access variables in a nested scope. The nonlocal keyword enables the programmer to access and modify variables in the enclosing scope of a function. You can use nonlocal keyword to define a nested function as follow:

```
def outer_function():
    outer_value = "Outer Value"
    
    def inner_function():
        nonlocal outer_value
        outer_value= "Inner Value"
        print(outer_value)
    
    inner_function()
    print(outer_value)
    
outer_function()
```

In the above code, we define outer_value in outer_function and access it inside the inner_function using the nonlocal keyword. The output will be "Inner value" for the inner function and "Inner value" for the outer function.

6. Conclusion:

The function scoping feature of Python 3.10 is highly effective for managing functions within a program. The local, global, and nested scopes, along with the non-local keyword, offer ample versatility to developers. The above-discussed topics are essential for any programmer who wishes to excel in Python 3.10 programming. Using this guide, you can efficiently apply function scoping in Python 3.10 to create effective programs.
