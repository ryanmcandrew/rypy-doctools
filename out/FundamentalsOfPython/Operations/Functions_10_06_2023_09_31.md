Lesson 1: Introduction to Functions
Functions are a powerful tool in Python that allow you to perform a task or a series of tasks with a single line of code. In this lesson, we'll introduce you to the basics of functions and show you how to define and call them in Python.

Tutorial:
1.1 Defining Functions in Python
A function in Python is created using the def keyword, followed by the function name, and a set of parentheses. Any arguments being passed to the function are included within the parentheses. 

Example:
def my_function():
    print("Hello, World!")

In this example, we have created a function called my_function that simply prints the words "Hello, World!" to the console when called.

1.2 Calling Functions in Python
To call a function in Python, we simply refer to the name of the function and include any arguments required within the parentheses.

Example:
my_function()

The above line of code will call the my_function function and execute the code within the function, resulting in "Hello, World!" being printed to the console.

Lesson 2: Function Arguments
Functions are designed to accept arguments, also known as inputs or parameters, that allow you to pass information into the function that can be used to perform a specific task or return a specific value. In this lesson, we'll learn how to define function arguments and use default and keyword arguments.

Tutorial:
2.1 Function Arguments
Defining arguments in a function is as easy as including them within the parentheses when the function is defined. In Python, we have two types of function arguments: positional arguments and keyword arguments. Positional arguments are defined in order and are assigned values based on their position within the function call. Keyword arguments are defined using the name assigned to the argument in the function definition.

Example:

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

In this example, we have defined a function called add_numbers that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their sum.

2.2 Default Arguments
In Python, we have the ability to specify default values for function arguments. In cases where an argument is not passed to the function, the default value will be used instead.

Example:

def say_hello(name=""):
    if name:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    else:
        print("Hello, World!")

In this example, we have defined a function called say_hello that takes a single argument, name. If the argument is passed, the function will print "Hello, {name}!". If no argument is passed, the function will print "Hello, World!".

2.3 Keyword Arguments
Keyword arguments are defined using the name assigned to the argument in the function definition. This allows you to pass arguments to a function in any order, so long as you use the name assigned to that argument in the function definition.

Example:

def create_user(username, email, password):
    # Insert code to create a new user account
  
create_user(email="example@example.com", username="example_user", password="top_secret")

In this example, we have defined a function called create_user that takes three arguments: username, email, and password. By including the argument name before the value, we can pass the arguments in any order we like.

Lesson 3: Return Statements
Return statements are used in functions to return a value or series of values to the calling code. In this lesson, we'll learn how to use return statements in functions, as well as how to return multiple values.

Tutorial:
3.1 Basic Return Statements
A basic return statement is used to return a value from a function. In Python, we use the return keyword followed by the value to be returned.

Example:

def multiply_numbers(x, y):
    return x * y

In this example, we have defined a function called multiply_numbers that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their product.

3.2 Returning Multiple Values
In Python, we have the ability to return multiple values from a single function using tuples.

Example:

def calculate_stats(numbers):
    count = len(numbers)
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / count
    return count, total, average

In this example, we have defined a function called calculate_stats that takes a list of numbers and returns the count, total, and average of the list as a tuple.

Lesson 4: Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are a type of function used to define a small, anonymous function that can be used in the same way as any other function in your code. In this lesson, we'll learn how to create and use lambda functions in Python.

Tutorial:
4.1 Basic Lambda Functions
In Python, a lambda function is created using the lambda keyword followed by any arguments that need to be passed to the function. The final value returned by the function is specified after the colon.

Example:

multiply_numbers = lambda x, y: x * y

In this example, we have defined a lambda function called multiply_numbers that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their product.

4.2 Using Lambda Functions
Lambda functions can be used in a variety of ways when working with Python code. One of the most common uses for lambda functions is with the built-in map, filter, and reduce functions.

Example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)

In this example, we have used the map function with a lambda function to create a list of squared numbers from a list of numbers. The lambda function takes a single argument, x, and returns x ** 2 for each item in the numbers list.

Lesson 5: Scope and Naming in Functions
Scope and naming are important concepts to understand when working with functions in Python. In this lesson, we'll explain what these concepts mean and how they can impact your functions.

Tutorial:
5.1 Global vs. Local Variables
A variable's scope in Python determines how and where the variable can be accessed within your code. Global variables are defined in the main body of the code and can be accessed from within any function or block of code. Local variables are defined within a function or block of code and can only be accessed from within that function or block of code.

Example:

global_variable = "I am a global variable!"

def print_variable():
    local_variable = "I am a local variable!"
    print(global_variable)
    print(local_variable)
    
In this example, we have defined both a global_variable and a local_variable. The print_variable function can access the global_variable, but not the local_variable outside of the function. Conversely, any code outside of the function can access global_variable, but not local_variable.

5.2 Naming Conventions
Choosing descriptive and meaningful names for your function can help improve readability and reduce confusion in your code. Additionally, it is important to follow Python's naming conventions when naming your functions and variables.

Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores. For example, calculate_average is a valid function name.

Lesson 6: Conclusion
Functions are a powerful tool in Python that can help you write cleaner, more maintainable code. By using functions to group related code together and simplify your overall logic, you can make your code easier to understand, easier to update, and easier to debug.
