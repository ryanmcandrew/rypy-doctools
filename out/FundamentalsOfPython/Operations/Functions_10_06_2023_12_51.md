How to Course on Using Functions in Python Version 3.10

Introduction
Functions are a fundamental part of programming in Python – they are powerful building blocks that can be used to create complex programs. Python allows the use of pre-built functions as well as the creation of custom functions to suit specific programming needs. In this course, we will cover the basic syntax used in creating and calling functions in Python version 3.10. 

Part 1: Creating Functions 

Step 1.1: Function Definition
To create a function, use the keyword “def,” followed by the name of the function and parentheses.

Example: 
def my_function(): 
  print(“Hello, World!”) 

Step 1.2: Function Body
The code inside the function should be indented and will be executed when the function is called.

Example:
def my_function():
  print("Hello, World!")
  print("Welcome to functions in Python.")

Step 1.3: Function Invocation 
To call a function, simply write its name and parentheses.

Example:
my_function()

Output: 
Hello, World!
Welcome to functions in Python.

Part 2: Passing Arguments 

Step 2.1: Parameters 
To pass arguments into a function, include them inside the parentheses when defining a function using parameters. 
Example: 
def my_function(name): 
  print("Hello, " + name + “!”) 

Step 2.2: Positional Arguments 
Positional arguments are passed in a specific, predefined order into a function. 

Example: 
my_function("Nate") 

Output: 
Hello, Nate! 

Step 2.3: Keyword Arguments 
Keyword arguments allow you to pass arguments into a function based on their names – no ordering is necessary. 

Example:
my_function(name="Nate")

Output: 
Hello, Nate! 

Part 3: Return Statements 

Step 3.1: Return Syntax 
Return statements let you return a value back from a function. 

Example: 
def add_numbers(x, y): 
  return x + y 

Step 3.2: Output of Return Statements 
When we invoke a function with a return statement, the value is returned and can be used in the program. 

Example: 
print(add_numbers(3, 5)) 

Output: 
8 

Part 4: Conclusion 
In this course, we covered the basic syntax used in creating and calling functions in Python 3.10. We learned how to create a function using the “def” keyword, how to pass arguments into functions using parameters, both positional and keyword arguments, and how to output the value of a function using a return statement. By following these steps, you can now create your own custom functions to suit your specific programming needs.
