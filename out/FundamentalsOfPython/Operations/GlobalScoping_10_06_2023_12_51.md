global scoping
==============
Introduction:

Global scoping in Python is an important concept to understand as it enables you to define a variable or function that can be accessed from any part of the program. In this course, we will discuss what global scoping is, how it works, and how to use it in Python version 3.10.

Lesson 1: Understanding Global Scoping

Global scoping refers to the concept of creating a variable that can be accessed from any part of the program. In Python, when a variable is defined outside of a function, it is considered a global variable and can be accessed from any part of the program. 

For example, let's define a variable x outside of a function:

x = 5

Now, we can access the value of x from anywhere in the program, as shown below:

def print_x():
  print(x)

print_x() # Output: 5

Lesson 2: Updating a Global Variable

To update a global variable, you can simply assign a new value to the variable. For example, let's update the value of x:

x = 5

def update_x():
  global x
  x = 10

update_x() # Value of x is now 10
print(x) # Output: 10

When updating a global variable from within a function, you need to use the global keyword to indicate that you are referring to the global variable.

Lesson 3: Global Scoping with Nested Functions

In Python, you can also define functions within functions. When a function is defined within another function, it is called a nested function. In such cases, the inner function can access the variables of the outer function, but the outer function cannot access the variables of the inner function.

For example:

def outer_function():
  x = 5
  
  def inner_function():
    print(x)

  inner_function()

outer_function() # Output: 5

In this example, the inner_function is defined within the outer_function and it can access the variable x defined in the outer_function.

Lesson 4: Avoiding Global Variables

Although global variables can be useful in some cases, they should be avoided as much as possible. This is because global variables can make your code less readable and can lead to hard-to-find bugs. 

Instead of using global variables, it is recommended to use function arguments and return statements to pass data between functions. 

Conclusion:

Global scoping is an important concept to understand in Python as it enables you to define a variable or function that can be accessed from any part of the program. In this course, we discussed what global scoping is, how it works, and how to use it in Python version 3.10. Remember to avoid using global variables when possible to keep your code readable and maintainable.
