Introduction to Hexadecimal in Python 3.10:

Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, which means that it consists of 16 digits (0-9 and A-F). In Python 3.10, hexadecimal numbers can be indicated by the prefix "0x". This prefix distinguishes the number from decimal (base-10) numbers.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use hexadecimal in Python 3.10.


Step 1: Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal in Python

To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, you can use the built-in function hex().

For example, let's say you want to convert the decimal number 255 to hexadecimal:

```
decimal_number = 255
hex_number = hex(decimal_number)
```

Here, the variable hex_number will store the hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal_number, which is "0xff".

You can also use the format() method to convert decimal to hexadecimal:

```
decimal_number = 255
hex_number = format(decimal_number, "x")
```

The "x" in the format() method specifies that you want the output to be in hexadecimal format.


Step 2: Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal in Python

To convert a hexadecimal number to decimal, you can use the built-in function int().

For example, let's say you have the hexadecimal number "0xff" and you want to convert it to decimal:

```
hex_number = "0xff"
decimal_number = int(hex_number, 16)
```

Here, the variable decimal_number will store the decimal equivalent of the hex_number, which is 255.

You can also use the format() method to convert hexadecimal to decimal:

```
hex_number = "0xff"
decimal_number = int(hex_number, base=16)
```

The "base" argument in the int() method specifies that the input is in hexadecimal format.


Step 3: Using Hexadecimal in Python Code

You can use hexadecimal numbers in your Python code for various purposes, such as specifying colors in graphics or bitwise operations.

Here is an example of using hexadecimal in Python code to specify a color in graphics:

```python
import turtle

turtle.bgcolor("#2D2D2D")
turtle.color("#FFA500")
turtle.pensize(4)

for i in range(5):
    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.right(144)

turtle.done()
```

In this code, #2D2D2D is the hexadecimal equivalent of the color gray, and #FFA500 is the hexadecimal equivalent of the color orange.

Conclusion:

In this tutorial, you learned how to use hexadecimal in Python 3.10 for various purposes. You learned how to convert decimal to hexadecimal and vice versa, and how to use hexadecimal in Python code.
