the ~ operator
==============
Introduction:

The ~ operator is known as bitwise negation operator in Python which performs the negative of a binary number. It replaces the digits of the binary number with their opposites and results in a new binary number. Let's understand the working of the ~ operator in python 3.10 along with its syntax.

Syntax:

~number

The symbol ~ followed by an operand returns its integer's negation value.

Steps:

1. Initialize a variable with any integer value.

Example: 

number = 10

2. Apply the ~ operator on the variable.

Example:

result = ~number

3. Print the result of the operation.

Example:

print(result)

This will return the value -11.

Example:

number = 57
result = ~number
print(result)

This will return the value -58.

Note: The ~ operator works on the binary representation of numbers. Therefore, when we apply the ~ operator to a number, first its binary representation is generated by converting the decimal number to its binary equivalent. Once the binary number is generated, the digits in that number are inverted, and the result is returned.

Conclusion:

In this tutorial, we learned about the ~ operator in Python version 3.10. We saw its syntax, how it works on binary representation, and how to use it in your Python code. The ~ operator is important for performing bitwise operations and calculations in Python.
