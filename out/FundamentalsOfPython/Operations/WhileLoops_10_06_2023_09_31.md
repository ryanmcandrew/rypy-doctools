===========
Lesson 1: Introduction to While Loops

In Python 3.10, while loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as the condition specified in the loop header remains true. The basic syntax of a while loop is as follows:

while condition:
    # code to be repeated

Here, `condition` is an expression that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the expression is true, the code inside the loop is executed. This process continues until the condition becomes false.

Lesson 2: Basic While Loop Examples

Let's start with a couple of basic while loop examples. The first example prints the numbers 1 to 5:

i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

In this example, `i` is initialized to 1, and the while loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5. Inside the loop, we print the current value of `i` and then increment it by 1 using the `+=` operator.

The second example prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 10, and keeps prompting until a valid number is entered:

number = 0

while number < 1 or number > 10:
    number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 10: "))

Here, we initialize `number` to 0, and the while loop continues as long as `number` is less than 1 or greater than 10. Inside the loop, we prompt the user to enter a number using the `input()` function, convert the input to an integer using the `int()` function, and assign the result to `number`.

Lesson 3: Using Break and Continue Statements

Sometimes it is necessary to exit a while loop early or skip certain iterations of the loop. The `break` and `continue` statements can be used for this purpose.

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. Here's an example:

i = 1

while i <= 5:
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1

In this example, the loop exits after printing the numbers 1 and 2, because the `break` statement is executed when `i` is equal to 3.

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Here's an example:

i = 1

while i <= 5:
    if i == 3:
        i += 1
        continue
    print(i)
    i += 1

In this example, the number 3 is skipped because the `continue` statement is executed when `i` is equal to 3.

Lesson 4: Using While Loops with Lists and Dictionaries

While loops can also be used with lists and dictionaries to iterate over the elements in the collection. Here's an example of using a while loop with a list:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

i = 0

while i < len(my_list):
    print(my_list[i])
    i += 1

In this example, we use the `len()` function to determine the length of the list, and then iterate over the elements using an index variable `i`.

Here's an example of using a while loop with a dictionary:

my_dict = {"apple": 1, "orange": 2, "banana": 3}

keys = list(my_dict.keys())

i = 0

while i < len(keys):
    print(keys[i], my_dict[keys[i]])
    i += 1

In this example, we use the `keys()` method to get a list of all the keys in the dictionary. We then iterate over the keys using an index variable `i`, and print the key-value pairs using the `print()` function.

Lesson 5: Conclusion

In this course, you learned the basics of using while loops in Python 3.10. You also learned how to use the `break` and `continue` statements to exit loops early or skip iterations. Finally, you learned how to use while loops with lists and dictionaries. With this knowledge, you should be able to write more complex programs that involve looping.
