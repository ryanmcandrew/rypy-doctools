==========
Introduction
In this course, we will delve into the fundamentals of data types in Python 3.10. Python is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that the interpreter infers data types at runtime, rather than requiring the programmer to declare them explicitly.

We will cover the following data types in Python 3.10:

1. Numbers
2. Strings
3. Lists
4. Tuples
5. Dictionaries
6. Sets

Throughout this course, we will be providing code examples to illustrate each data type and its properties.

1. Numbers

Numbers in Python can be represented as integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers.

Example:

# Integer
x = 5

# Floating point
y = 2.5

# Complex number
z = 3 + 4j

Python also provides numeric operators to perform arithmetic operations.

Example:

# Addition
5 + 2 # Output: 7

# Subtraction
5 - 2 # Output: 3

# Multiplication
5 * 2 # Output: 10

# Division
5 / 2 # Output: 2.5

# Floor Division
5 // 2 # Output: 2

# Modulus
5 % 2 # Output: 1

# Exponentiation
5 ** 2 # Output: 25

2. Strings

Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed within single or double quotes.

Example:

text = "Hello, World!"

Python strings also support several string methods to manipulate them.

Example:

text.upper() # Output: 'HELLO, WORLD!'

text.lower() # Output: 'hello, world!'

text.capitalize() # Output: 'Hello, world!'

text.replace('Hello', 'Hi') # Output: 'Hi, World!'

3. Lists

Lists in Python are ordered sequences of elements enclosed within square brackets. Lists can contain elements of different data types.

Example:

my_list = [1, 'two', 3.5, ['four', 'five']]

Python lists also support several list methods to manipulate them.

Example:

my_list.append('six') # Output: [1, 'two', 3.5, ['four', 'five'], 'six']

my_list.insert(2, 'three') # Output: [1, 'two', 'three', 3.5, ['four', 'five']]

my_list.pop() # Output: ['four', 'five']

4. Tuples

Tuples in Python are ordered sequences of elements enclosed within parentheses. Tuples can contain elements of different data types.

Example:

my_tuple = (1, 'two', 3.5, ['four', 'five'])

Python tuples are immutable, meaning that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified.

5. Dictionaries

Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces. Dictionaries can contain elements of different data types.

Example:

my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 26, 'address': {'street': 'Main Street', 'city': 'San Francisco'}}

Python dictionaries also support several dictionary methods to manipulate them.

Example:

my_dict.get('name') # Output: 'John'

my_dict['name'] = 'Jane' # Output: {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 26, 'address': {'street': 'Main Street', 'city': 'San Francisco'}}

my_dict.pop('address') # Output: {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 26}

6. Sets

Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements enclosed within curly braces or created using the set() constructor.

Example:

my_set1 = {1, 2, 3}

my_set2 = set([3, 4, 5])

Python sets also support several set methods to manipulate them.

Example:

my_set1.add(4) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

my_set1.union(my_set2) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

my_set1.intersection(my_set2) # Output: {3}

Conclusion

In this course, we have covered the fundamental data types in Python 3.10 along with code examples to illustrate their properties and manipulation. These data types provide the foundation for any Python program, and understanding them is crucial to developing robust, efficient programs.
