data types
==========
Introduction:

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the data types of variables are inferred from their values at runtime instead of being explicitly declared in code. However, it is still important to understand the different data types available in Python, as well as their specific features and uses.

In this course, we will cover the following Python data types:

1. Numeric data types
2. String data type
3. List data type
4. Tuple data type
5. Set data type
6. Dictionary data type
7. Boolean data type

1. Numeric data types:

Python supports three types of numeric data:

- Integer: integers are whole numbers with no decimal points.

Example:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))   #Output: <class 'int'>
```

- Float: floats are numbers with a decimal point.

Example:

```python
x = 5.0
print(type(x))   #Output: <class 'float'>
```

- Complex: complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, denoted by the letter j.

Example:

```python
x = 2 + 3j
print(type(x))  #Output: <class 'complex'>
```

2. String data type:

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. They are immutable, meaning the contents of a string cannot be changed once it has been created.

Example:

```python
x = "Hello, World!"
print(type(x))   #Output: <class 'str'>
```

3. List data type:

Lists are ordered sequences of values enclosed in square brackets. They can contain values of any data type, including other lists. Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified.

Example:

```python
x = [1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0]
print(type(x))   #Output: <class 'list'>
```

4. Tuple data type:

Tuples are ordered sequences of values enclosed in parentheses. They can contain values of any data type, including other tuples. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable.

Example:

```python
x = (1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0)
print(type(x))   #Output: <class 'tuple'>
```

5. Set data type:

Sets are unordered collections of unique values enclosed in curly braces. They can contain values of any data type, and duplicates are automatically removed. Sets are mutable.

Example:

```python
x = {1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0}
print(type(x))   #Output: <class 'set'>
```

6. Dictionary data type:

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. The keys must be unique and immutable data types, while the values can be of any data type. Dictionaries are mutable.

Example:

```python
x = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(type(x))   #Output: <class 'dict'>
```

7. Boolean data type:

Booleans are a built-in data type for representing truth values. They can only have two possible values: True or False.

Example:

```python
x = True
print(type(x))   #Output: <class 'bool'>
```

Conclusion:

In this course, we have gone through the different data types available in Python and their specific features and uses. By understanding the different data types, you can write more efficient and effective Python scripts.
