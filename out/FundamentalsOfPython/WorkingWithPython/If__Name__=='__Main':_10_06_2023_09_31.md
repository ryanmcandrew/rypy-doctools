if __name__ == '__main':
========================
Introduction:

In Python version 3.10, you can use the if __name__ == '__main__' statement to allow code to be executed only when the script is run directly and not when it is imported as a module. This is a useful feature when creating scripts that may be used both as standalone programs or as modules within other programs.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the if __name__ == '__main__' statement in Python 3.10 with code examples.

Step 1: Create a Python script and import modules

First, create a new Python script by opening a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and saving the file with a .py extension. In this example, we will name the file main.py.

Next, import any modules that will be used in the script. For example:

```python
import os
import sys
import datetime
```

Step 2: Define functions or classes

Next, define any functions or classes that will be used in the script. For example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hi, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")

def get_current_time():
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    return now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")

def is_admin(user_name):
    return user_name == "admin"
```

Step 3: Add code to be executed only when the script is run directly

Use the if __name__ == '__main__' statement to define code that will be executed only when the script is run directly. For example:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("This code is executed only when the script is run directly.")
    print(f"The current time is {get_current_time()}")

    person = Person("John", 30)
    person.greet()

    user_name = input("Enter your username: ")
    if is_admin(user_name):
        print("You have admin privileges.")
    else:
        print("You do not have admin privileges.")
```

In this example, the print statements, Person instance creation, and input validation will only be executed when the script is run directly. If the script is imported as a module, none of this code will be executed.

Step 4: Execute the script

Save the script and execute it from the command line using the python command followed by the name of the script. For example:

```
python main.py
```

Output:

```
This code is executed only when the script is run directly.
The current time is 12:34:56
Hi, my name is John and I'm 30 years old.
Enter your username: admin
You have admin privileges.
```

Conclusion

The if __name__ == '__main__' statement is a useful tool for controlling the execution of code in Python scripts. By using this statement, you can ensure that code is executed only when the script is run directly and not when it is imported as a module. This can help prevent unintended behavior and make your code more modular and reusable.
