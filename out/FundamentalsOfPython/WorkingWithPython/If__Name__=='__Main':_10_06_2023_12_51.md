if __name__ == '__main':
========================
How to Use if __name__ == '__main__' in Python 3.10 

In Python, when we import a module or a package, the code in it gets executed. However, sometimes we want certain code within it to run only when the module is executed as the main program, but not when it's imported as a module in another program. In such cases, we use the if __name__ == '__main__' statement. It tells Python to run the code inside the if block only if the module is being executed as the main program.

Here's how to use the if __name__ == '__main__' statement in Python 3.10 

Step 1: Define the functions or classes you want to use:

For our example, let's create a module named 'example.py' that contains a few functions and a class.

Example:

``` python
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

def cube(x):
    return x ** 3

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        print("Hello, my name is", self.name, "and I'm", self.age, "years old.")
```

Step 2:  Add the if __name__ == '__main__' block 

In the same module file, add the code to be executed only when the module is executed as the main program.

Example:

``` python
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

def cube(x):
    return x ** 3

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        print("Hello, my name is", self.name, "and I'm", self.age, "years old.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(square(5))
    print(cube(5))

    s = Student("John", 25)
    s.introduce()
```

In the above code, the print statements and the instance of the Student class will only be executed when the module is executed as the main program.

Step 3: Execute the code 

To execute the code, run the module in the command line by typing:

``` python example.py```

Output:

```
25
125
Hello, my name is John and I'm 25 years old.
```

The print statements and the instance of the Student class are executed because they are inside the if __name__ == '__main__' block. If we import this module in another program, this block will not be executed.

Additional Tips:

1. Always put the code that you want to execute when the module is executed as the main program inside the if __name__ == '__main__' statement.

2. You can run multiple scripts using the same code in the same interpreter session. 

That's how you use the if __name__ == '__main__' statement in Python 3.10.
