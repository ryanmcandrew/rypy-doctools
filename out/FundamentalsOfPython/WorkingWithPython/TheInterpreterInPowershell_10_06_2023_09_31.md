Here's a how-to course with code examples on using the interpreter in PowerShell in Python version 3.10:

1. Install Python version 3.10:

Make sure you have Python version 3.10 installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the official Python website.

2. Open PowerShell:

Open PowerShell by clicking on the Start menu and typing "PowerShell" in the search bar. Click on "Windows PowerShell" to open the PowerShell command line interface.

3. Start the Python Interpreter:

In PowerShell, type "python" and press enter to open the Python interpreter.

4. Use Python commands and functions:

Once the interpreter is open, you can use any Python command or function. For example, type "print('Hello, World!')" and press enter to print a message to the console.

```

```
PS C:\Users\UserName> python scriptname.py
```

6. Exit the Python interpreter:
