Introduction

A virtual environment is a tool that enables you to create an isolated Python environment for your project. With venv, you can create a virtual environment for your Python project with a specific version of Python and specific dependencies. This ensures that your project dependencies do not clash with each other and that your project is not affected by system settings or other projects running on the system.

In this course, you will learn how to use venv in Python version 3.10.

Prerequisites

This course assumes that you have Python 3.10 installed on your system.

Create a Virtual Environment

To create a new virtual environment, you can use the venv module. Here is an example of how to create a virtual environment named myenv:

```
python3.10 -m venv myenv
```

This will create a new virtual environment named myenv in your current directory.

Activate the Virtual Environment

Once you have created your virtual environment, you need to activate it to use it. Here is an example of how to activate the myenv virtual environment on Linux or macOS:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

This will activate the myenv virtual environment and set up the PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables to point to the Python executable and the installed packages within the virtual environment.

Install Packages

To install packages in your virtual environment, you can use the pip command. Here is an example of how to install the requests package:

```
pip install requests
```

This will install the requests package within the myenv virtual environment, and it will not affect any other virtual environment or system-level installation of Python.

Freeze Dependencies

To freeze your project dependencies, you can use the pip freeze command. Here is an example of how to freeze the dependencies of your project:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will generate a requirements.txt file that lists all the installed packages in your virtual environment and their version numbers. This file can be used to recreate the environment on another system or to deploy your project.

Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you finish working with your virtual environment, you should deactivate it. Here is an example of how to deactivate the myenv virtual environment:

```
deactivate
```

This will deactivate the myenv virtual environment and restore your system's original Python environment.

Conclusion

venv is a powerful tool that enables you to create an isolated Python environment for your project. By using venv, you can ensure that your project dependencies do not clash with each other and that your project is not affected by system settings or other projects running on the system. This course has provided an introduction to using venv in Python 3.10, including creating a virtual environment, activating and deactivating the virtual environment, installing packages, and freezing dependencies.
