Levenstein Distance
===================
Introduction:
Levenshtein Distance is a metric function used to measure the difference between two strings. It is used to calculate the minimum number of single-character edits required to transform one string into the other. This metric is also sometimes known as the edit distance.

In this course, we will learn how to implement Leavenstein Distance in Python 3.10.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.10 and a good understanding of string manipulation in Python are essential.

Step 1: Importing the necessary libraries
The first step is to import the necessary libraries. We require the "numpy" library to calculate the minimum operations required.

```
import numpy as np
```

Step 2: Defining the Levenshtein Distance Function
Next, we define a function that calculates the Levenshtein Distance of two strings. We will name this function "levenshtein_distance". The function takes two arguments - "str1" and "str2".

```
def levenshtein_distance(str1, str2):
    n = len(str1)
    m = len(str2)
    d = np.zeros((n+1, m+1))
    for i in range(n+1):
        d[i][0] = i
    for j in range(m+1):
        d[0][j] = j
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        for j in range(1,m+1):
            if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
                d[i][j] = d[i-1][j-1]
            else:
                d[i][j] = min(d[i-1][j]+1, d[i][j-1]+1, d[i-1][j-1]+1)
    return d[n][m]
```

The implementation follows the following algorithm:
1. Initialize an array of zeros of dimensions (n+1, m+1). Here, "n" and "m" are the lengths of the two input strings.
2. Initialize the first column and row of the array to their corresponding indices (0 to n and 0 to m).
3. Loop through the array and perform the following operations:
    - If the characters at the current position of the two strings match, the cost of the current operation is the same as the cost of the previous operation. In other words, there is no "edit" required.
    - If the characters at the current position of the two strings do not match, the minimum of the insertion, deletion, and substitution costs is calculated and added to the cost of the previous operation.
4. Return the final value of the array, which represents the minimum number of edits required to transform the first string into the second string.

Step 3: Example Usage
We can now use this function to calculate the minimum number of edits required to transform one string into another.

```
str1 = "kitten"
str2 = "sitting"
distance = levenshtein_distance(str1, str2)
print(f"The Levenshtein Distance between {str1} and {str2} is {distance}")
```

Output:
```
The Levenshtein Distance between kitten and sitting is 3
```

Conclusion:
This course explains how to implement Levenshtein Distance in Python 3.10. Levenshtein Distance is a useful metric for measuring the difference between two strings, and the implementation described in this course can be used in a variety of applications.
