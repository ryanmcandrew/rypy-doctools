Introduction:

Pandas is an open-source data manipulation library for Python. It is used for data analysis, data manipulation, data visualization, and data cleaning. Pandas is built on top of the Numpy library, and it is an essential tool for data scientists who work with data in Python. In this course, we will learn how to use Pandas in Python version 3.10.

Prerequisites:

To follow this course, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming and data structures. You should be familiar with Python libraries, including Numpy.

Modules Required:

To use pandas in Python version 3.10, we need to install it. We can install it using pip, which is a package installer for Python. Use the following command to install pandas:

pip install pandas

Once the installation is complete, we can start using pandas.

Step 1: Import Pandas

Before we start using pandas, we need to import the pandas library into our Python code. To import pandas, use the following command:

import pandas as pd

It is a common practice in Python to use a short name when importing libraries to reduce the amount of code we need to write.

Step 2: Read Data from a CSV File

To read data from a CSV file, we can use pandas' read_csv() function. The read_csv() function reads data from a CSV file and converts it into a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure that is similar to a spreadsheet.

To read data from a CSV file, use the following command:

data = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')

Replace ‘filename.csv’ with the name of the CSV file you want to read. The read_csv() function reads the CSV file and saves it in the data variable as a pandas DataFrame.

Step 3: View Data

To view the data we have read from the CSV file, we can use the head() function. The head() function returns the first 5 rows of the DataFrame. To view more rows, you can specify the number of rows you want to view as a parameter inside the function.

Use the following command to view the first 5 rows of the DataFrame:

data.head()

This will display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.

Step 4: Data Selection

Pandas provides various methods for data selection. We can select rows, columns, and specific data using these methods.

To select a specific column of the DataFrame, we can use the square bracket notation. For example, if we want to select the ‘Name’ column of the DataFrame, we can use the following command:

data['Name']

This will display the values in the ‘Name’ column of the DataFrame.

To select a specific row, we can use the loc() function. For example, if we want to select the third row of the DataFrame, we can use the following command:

data.loc[2]

This will display the third row of the DataFrame.

To select a specific data point, we can combine both the square bracket notation and the loc() function. For example, if we want to select the name of the third person in the DataFrame, we can use the following command:

data['Name'].loc[2]

This will display the name of the third person in the DataFrame.

Step 5: Data Manipulation

Pandas provides various methods for data manipulation. We can add, remove, and modify data in the DataFrame using these methods.

To add a new column to the DataFrame, we can use the following command:

data['Age in 2022'] = 2022 - data['Birth Year']

This command creates a new column in the DataFrame called ‘Age in 2022’ and fills it with the age of each person in 2022.

To remove a specific column from the DataFrame, we can use the drop() function. For example, if we want to remove the ‘Birth Year’ column from the DataFrame, we can use the following command:

data = data.drop('Birth Year', axis=1)

This command removes the ‘Birth Year’ column from the DataFrame.

To modify the values of a specific column, we can use the square bracket notation. For example, if we want to modify the ‘Name’ of the first person in the DataFrame, we can use the following command:

data['Name'][0] = 'John Doe'

This command modifies the ‘Name’ of the first person in the DataFrame to ‘John Doe’.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Pandas is an essential tool for data scientists who work with data in Python. The library provides various methods for data analysis, data manipulation, data visualization, and data cleaning. In this course, we learned how to use pandas in Python version 3.10. We covered the basics of reading data from CSV files, selecting data from a DataFrame, manipulating data in a DataFrame, and more. With this knowledge, you should be able to work with data using pandas in Python version 3.10.
