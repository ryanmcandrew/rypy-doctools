Note: The following course assumes that you have already installed Python and pandas on your system. 

What is pandas?
Pandas is a python library used for data analysis, it is built on top of another python library called numpy. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools that make it suitable for working with structured and tabular data.

Lesson 1: Getting Started

1.1. Import pandas

Before we can start using pandas we need to import it into our Python environment. Type the following command to import pandas:

import pandas as pd

1.2. Pandas Data Structure

Pandas has two primary data structures, Series and DataFrame.

A Series is a one-dimensional array with labels called an index, and each column of a DataFrame is a Series. A DataFrame is a two-dimensional array with labeled axes (rows and columns).

1.3. Creating a Series

A Series can be created in pandas using the pd.Series() function.

For example, let's create a Series of numbers:

import pandas as pd
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
s = pd.Series(numbers)
print(s)

Output:
0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
4    5
dtype: int64

1.4. Creating a DataFrame

A DataFrame can be created in pandas using the pd.DataFrame() function. 

For example, let's create a DataFrame of different fruits and their respective quantities:

import pandas as pd
 
data = {'Fruit': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Grapes'],
        'Quantity': [10, 6, 15, 25]}
 
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

Output:
    Fruit  Quantity
0   Apple        10
1  Banana         6
2  Orange        15
3  Grapes        25


Lesson 2: Importing Data

Pandas can be used to import data from various file formats including CSV, TXT, Excel, and SQL database, etc.

2.1. Importing CSV

To import data from a CSV file, we can use the pd.read_csv() method.

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(data.head())

The above code will import a CSV file named 'data.csv' and print the first five rows.

2.2. Importing Excel File

Pandas can also import data from an Excel file using the pd.read_excel() method.

For example:

data = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')
print(data.head())

The above code will import an Excel file named 'data.xlsx' and print the first five rows.


Lesson 3: Data Manipulation

Pandas offers a variety of ways to manipulate data, some of which include selecting data, filtering data, and sorting data.

3.1. Selecting Data

To select specific data from a DataFrame, we can use indexing operators [] or loc and iloc.

For example, let's retrieve the Quantity column from the above fruit DataFrame.

df_quantity = df['Quantity']
print(df_quantity)

Output:
0    10
1     6
2    15
3    25
Name: Quantity, dtype: int64

Similarly, we can also retrieve multiple columns using the indexing operator. For instance,

df_fruit_quantity = df[['Fruit', 'Quantity']]
print(df_fruit_quantity)

Output:
    Fruit  Quantity
0   Apple        10
1  Banana         6
2  Orange        15
3  Grapes        25

3.2. Filtering Data

Pandas allows us to filter data based on certain conditions. We can use the boolean operators such as >, <, ==, !=, etc. to create a boolean mask and filter the data.

For example, let's filter data to retrieve only the rows with a Quantity greater than 10.

df_filtered = df[df['Quantity'] > 10]
print(df_filtered)

Output:
    Fruit  Quantity
2  Orange        15
3  Grapes        25

3.3. Sorting Data

Pandas can also sort data based on the values in a specific column. We can use the sort_values() method to sort data.

For example, let's sort the fruit DataFrame by Quantity in ascending order.

df_sorted = df.sort_values('Quantity', ascending=True)
print(df_sorted)

Output:
    Fruit  Quantity
1  Banana         6
0   Apple        10
2  Orange        15
3  Grapes        25


Lesson 4: Data Visualization

Pandas also provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for data visualization. We can use various plotting functions such as line plot, bar plot, hist plot, etc.

4.1. Bar Plot

A bar plot can be created using the plot.bar() method.

For example, let's create a bar plot of the above fruit DataFrame.

df.plot.bar(x='Fruit', y='Quantity', rot=0)

The above code will create a bar plot of the fruit DataFrame.

4.2. Line Plot

A line plot can be created using the plot.line() method.

For example, let's create a line plot of the above fruit DataFrame.

df.plot.line(x='Fruit', y='Quantity', rot=0)

The above code will create a line plot of the fruit DataFrame.

4.3. Histogram Plot

A histogram plot can be created using the plot.hist() method.

For example, let's create a histogram plot of the Quantity column in the fruit DataFrame.

df['Quantity'].plot.hist()

The above code will create a histogram plot of the Quantity column in the fruit DataFrame.


Conclusion

Pandas is a powerful and popular data analysis library in Python. With its easy-to-use data structures and data manipulation functions, it is an essential tool for data analysis. In this course, we covered the basics of pandas, importing data, data manipulation, and data visualization. We hope this course helped you understand how to use pandas in Python 3.10.
