==========
As an AI language model, I can provide you with a basic guide to using Tensorflow in Python v 3.10. Please follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Tensorflow and Python
Firstly, you need to install Python 3.10 and, of course, the Tensorflow library. You can install both manually or through a package manager like pip.

Step 2: Import Tensorflow in your code
After installing Tensorflow, you can start using it by importing the Tensorflow package in your code. Use the following command to import the tensorflow module:

```
import tensorflow as tf
```
Step 3: Create Tensorflow Tensor
The Tensorflow library is based on data flow graphs. Everything in Tensorflow is a tensor which is a multi-dimensional array containing numerical data. You can create a Tensor object by using the Tensorflow constant API. Take a look at the following code:

```
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([3, 5, 7], dtype=tf.float32)
```
The resulting TensorFlow tensor is now ready for processing.

Step 4: Execute the Computation Graph
In this step, you will execute the graph that you created in the previous step. For this, you use the Tensorflow session API to create a session that runs the computation graph you created. The following code will illustrate this:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Constant vector, A
x = tf.constant([3, 5, 7], dtype=tf.float32)

# Create a session to run the computation graph
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(x)
    print(result)
```

After running this piece of code, you could obtain this output:

```
[3.0, 5.0, 7.0]
```

Step 5: Perform Computation
After creating the Tensorflow tensor, you can use different functions to perform operations like add, sub, matrix multiplication, etc. Letâ€™s take an example to add two tensors:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Constant vector, A
x = tf.constant([3, 5, 7], dtype=tf.float32)

# Constant vector, B
y = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)

# Add two constant vectors
z = tf.add(x, y)

# Create a session to run the computation graph
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(z)
    print(result)
```

The output after running this code would be:

```
[4. 7. 10.]
```

Conclusion:
In this tutorial, you learned how to use Tensorflow with Python 3.10. You learned to create a Tensor, execute a computation graph, and perform basic operations on tensors. There are many more advanced features, like variable, placeholders, neural networks, etc., that you can explore with TensorFlow. Keep learning and keep coding!
