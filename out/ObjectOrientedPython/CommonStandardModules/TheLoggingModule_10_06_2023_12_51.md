1. What is Logging in Python?

Logging is a technique used to track events that occur during application execution. You can use the logging module in Python to create a record of events, errors, and warnings that can help you identify problems when they occur. The logging module provides several log levels to help classify and prioritize the log output. 

2. Basic Log Setup 

To get started with logging in Python 3.10, you need to import the logging module and initialize it with a logger object. Here’s an example: 

```
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.debug('This is a debug message')
logger.info('This is an informational message')
logger.warning('This is a warning message')
logger.error('This is an error message')
logger.critical('This is a critical message')
```

In the above example, we set the logging level to DEBUG, which means that all messages with a severity level of DEBUG or higher will be logged. We then create a logger object and use it to log messages at different levels of severity. 

3. Logging Levels 

As mentioned earlier, the logging module provides several levels of severity to help you classify and prioritize log output. Here is a list of the available log levels in Python: 

- DEBUG 
- INFO 
- WARNING 
- ERROR 
- CRITICAL 

You can set the logging level to any of these levels based on the severity of the message you want to log. You can also filter messages based on their severity using a log filter. 

4. Log Formatting 

The logging module allows you to customize the format of log messages by specifying a formatter object. Here’s an example: 

```
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s:%(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info('This is an informational message')
```

In the above example, we defined a custom format for the log message that includes the timestamp and severity level. 

5. Adding a Log File Handler 

By default, log messages are sent to the console output. However, you can also save log messages to a file by adding a file handler to the logger object. Here’s an example: 

```
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='log.txt', format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s:%(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info('This is an informational message')
```

In the above example, we added a file handler to the logger object and specified a logfile name. 

6. Customizing Loggers 

The logging module allows you to customize loggers by adding handlers and filters to them. Here’s an example: 

```
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s:%(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

handler = logging.FileHandler('example.log')
handler.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

filter = logging.Filter('example')
filter.setLevel(logging.ERROR)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.addHandler(handler)
logger.addFilter(filter)

logger.info('This is an informational message for example')
logger.error('This is an error message for example')
```

In the above example, we added a file handler and a filter to the logger object for messages in the "example" namespace. We specified that the handler only logs messages with a severity level of WARNING or higher and that the filter only logs messages with a severity level of ERROR or higher. 

7. Exceptions and Tracebacks 

The logging module can also be used to log exceptions and tracebacks for debugging purposes. Here’s an example: 

```
import logging

def divide(a, b):
  try:
    return a / b
  except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f'Error: {e}', exc_info=True)

divide(1, 0)
```

In the above example, we defined a function that divides two numbers and logs any exceptions that occur. We also included the traceback information using the exc_info parameter. 

8. Best Practices 

Here are some best practices for using the logging module in Python: 

- Use meaningful log messages that are clear and concise. 
- Use the appropriate log level for each message based on the severity of the event. 
- Customize log output using formatters, handlers, and filters. 
- Use exceptions and tracebacks to identify and troubleshoot errors. 
- Log events in a structured way that is consistent across the application. 

Conclusion: 
In this course, you learned how to use the logging module in Python 3.10 to handle errors, debug code, and report exceptions. The logging module is an essential tool for any Python developer, and understanding its core concepts and best practices is critical for efficient application development.
