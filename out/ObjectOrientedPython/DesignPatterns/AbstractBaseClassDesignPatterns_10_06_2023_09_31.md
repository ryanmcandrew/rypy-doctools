abstract base class design patterns
===================================
Introduction:
Python version 3.10 introduced some new features and enhancements, including support for Abstract Base Class (ABC) Design Patterns. Abstract Base Classes are used in Python to define abstract methods that subclasses can implement, ensuring that the required methods are implemented and enforced, and that the subclass interacts with the parent class in a certain way.

In this course, we will discuss how to use abstract base class design patterns in Python version 3.10. We will cover the following topics:

1. What are Abstract Base Classes?
2. Why use Abstract Base Classes?
3. Creating Abstract Base Classes in Python
4. Defining Abstract Methods
5. Subclassing Abstract Base Classes
6. Implementing Abstract Methods
7. Applying ABC Design patterns to real-world problems

Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Python version 3.10 installation on your computer

1. What are Abstract Base Classes?
Abstract Base Classes (ABC) are classes in Python that define abstract methods, which can be implemented by the subclasses. Abstract methods are methods that are declared but not implemented in the parent class. Subclasses must implement these abstract methods to use the parent class.

2. Why use Abstract Base Classes?
The Abstract Base Class design pattern is used to provide a common interface for a group of classes. It ensures that the required methods are implemented and enforced, and that the subclass interacts with the parent class in a certain way. This design pattern also provides a way to specify the behavior of a particular class, without having to specify its implementation.

3. Creating Abstract Base Classes in Python:
To create an abstract base class, you need to import the 'abc' module and define the abstract method. An abstract method is a method that is declared but not implemented in the parent class. Here is an example:

```
import abc

class Vehicle(abc.ABC):
    @abc.abstractclassmethod
    def start(self):
        pass
```

4. Defining Abstract Methods:
An abstract method is defined using the '@abc.abstractclassmethod' decorator. This decorator ensures that the method is declared in the parent class but not implemented. Any subclass of the parent class must implement the abstract method.

5. Subclassing Abstract Base Classes:
To utilize the abstract class, you must create a subclass of it. A subclass can implement its own methods that the base class does not contain. However, it must also implement the abstract methods that the base class requires. Here is an example:

```
class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started...")
```

6. Implementing Abstract Methods:
To implement an abstract method, you need to define it in the subclass. The subclass must implement all the abstract methods of the parent class. Here is an example:

```
class Bike(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Kickstarted...")
```

7. Applying ABC Design patterns to real-world problems
The ABC design pattern is useful in many real-world problems. For example, if you are building a library that provides an abstraction for handling different types of data, you could use an abstract base class to define a common interface.

Conclusion:
The ABC Design pattern is a powerful tool for providing a common interface for a group of classes. It ensures that the required methods are implemented and enforced, and that the subclass interacts with the parent class in a certain way. With this course, you should now be able to use ABC Design patterns in your Python programming.
