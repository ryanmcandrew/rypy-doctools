model view controller design patterns
=====================================
Welcome to this course on using Model View Controller (MVC) design patterns in Python 3.10. In this course, we will cover the basic concepts behind MVC design patterns, how to implement them in Python 3.10, and how to build a simple application using the MVC design pattern.

What is the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern?
-----------------------------------------------------
MVC is a popular design pattern used in software development. It is a way of organizing your code into three distinct components: 
1. Model: The model represents data and the business logic that operates on that data.
2. View: The view is responsible for displaying the data to the user and capturing user input.
3. Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user requests and updating the model and view accordingly.

Advantages of MVC:
-------------------
1. Code Separation: The separation of concerns makes it easier to understand, modify, and reuse code.
2. Collaboration: Teams can work on separate components (Model, View & Controller) at the same time, speeding up the development process.
3. Scalability: MVC supports the separation of functionality, enabling developers to create complex applications without bloating the code.

Now let's start with the implementation of MVC design pattern in Python 3.10.

Step 1: Creating a Model class
-------------------------------

The first step is to create a class that represents the data and the business logic. This is called the Model. In our case, let’s say we are building an application to manage books. Here is how we can create our Model class:

```
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, publisher, isbn):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.publisher = publisher
        self.isbn = isbn

    def get_title(self):
        return self.title

    def get_author(self):
        return self.author

    def get_publisher(self):
        return self.publisher

    def get_isbn(self):
        return self.isbn
```

Here, we have created a Book class that represents a book. The class has a constructor that takes in the title, author, publisher, and isbn of the book. It also has four methods that return the title, author, publisher, and isbn of the book.

Step 2: Creating a View class
------------------------------

The next step is to create a class that is responsible for displaying data to the user. This is called the View. In our case, let’s say we want to display a list of books. Here is how we can create our View class:

```
class BookView:
    def show_books(self, books):
        for book in books:
            print(f"Title: {book.get_title()}")
            print(f"Author: {book.get_author()}")
            print(f"Publisher: {book.get_publisher()}")
            print(f"ISBN: {book.get_isbn()}\n")
```

Here, we have created a BookView class that has a method called show_books. This method takes in a list of books and displays them to the user.

Step 3: Creating a Controller class
-----------------------------------

The last step is to create a class that acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. This is called the Controller. In our case, let’s say we want to allow the user to add a book. Here is how we can create our Controller class:

```
class BookController:
    def __init__(self, model, view):
        self.model = model
        self.view = view

    def add_book(self, title, author, publisher, isbn):
        book = Book(title, author, publisher, isbn)
        self.model.add_book(book)

    def show_books(self):
        books = self.model.get_books()
        self.view.show_books(books)
```

Here, we have created a BookController class that takes in a Model and a View instance in its constructor. The class has two methods, add_book and show_books. The add_book method takes in the title, author, publisher, and isbn of the book and creates a new book using the Book class. It then adds the new book to the Model using the Model's add_book method. The show_books method gets all the books from the Model using the Model's get_books method and then displays them using the View's show_books method.

Step 4: Testing the application
--------------------------------

Now that we have our Model, View, and Controller classes, we can test the application. Here is an example of how we can use the application:

```
# Create a Model instance
model = BookModel()

# Create a View instance
view = BookView()

# Create a Controller instance
controller = BookController(model, view)

# Add a book
controller.add_book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", "JB Lippincott & Co", "978-0-06-174352-8")

# Show all books
controller.show_books()
```

Here, we create instances of the Model, View, and Controller classes. We then use the Controller instance to add a new book and display all the books using the View instance.

Conclusion
----------

In this course, we have learned the basics of implementing the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern in Python 3.10. We have created a Model class that represents data and business logic, a View class that is responsible for displaying data to the user, and a Controller class that acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. We have also learned how to test the application by adding a book and displaying all the books. With this knowledge, you can create complex applications using the MVC design pattern in Python 3.10.
