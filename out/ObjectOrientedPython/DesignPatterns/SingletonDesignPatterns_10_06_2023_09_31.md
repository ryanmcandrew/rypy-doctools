singleton design patterns
=========================
Introduction:
A singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that helps to ensure that a class can only contain one instance at a time. The main idea behind the singleton design pattern is to control the creation of objects by ensuring that no more than one instance can be created. Python 3.10 makes it easy to implement the singleton design pattern, and in this tutorial, we will walk through the steps required and illustrate with code examples.

Prerequisites:
To follow this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Object-Oriented Programming using Python. Additionally, you should have installed Python version 3.10 or a later version.

Steps:

1. Create a class: The first step is to create a class that contains the attributes and methods to be used in the program. This class should contain a class variable that will store the single instance of the class. The method to create the instance should be a static method that will check if the class has been instantiated previously, and if not, create a new instance.

Example:

class MyClass:
    __instance = None

    @staticmethod
    def getInstance():
        """ Static access method. """
        if MyClass.__instance == None:
            MyClass()
        return MyClass.__instance

    def __init__(self):
        """ Virtually private constructor. """
        if MyClass.__instance != None:
            raise Exception("This class is a singleton!")
        else:
            MyClass.__instance = self

2. Call the static method to create the instance: Using the example above, we can call the getInstance() method to create the object instance.

Example:

objA = MyClass.getInstance()
objB = MyClass.getInstance()
print(objA)
print(objB)

The above code will output the memory locations of the two instances. Since the class can only contain one instance at a time due to the singleton design pattern, the memory location for the two instances will be the same, and the output of the two print statements should be identical.

3. Overriding the __new__() method: Another method to implement the singleton design pattern in Python 3.10 is to override the __new__() method. This is done by creating a new class and overriding the __new__() method to call the parent class's __new__() method if the instance variable is None. If the instance variable is not None, the method will return the existing instance.

Example:

class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

4. Call the class to create the object instance: To create an instance using the __new__() method in the example above, we can call the class to create the object.

Example:

objA = Singleton()
objB = Singleton()
print(objA)
print(objB)

The above code will output the memory locations of the two instances. Since the class can only contain one instance at a time due to the singleton design pattern, the memory location for the two instances will be the same, and the output of the two print statements should be identical.

Conclusion:
In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement the singleton design pattern in Python version 3.10. We have shown two methods to create a singleton, one using a static method and the other by overriding the __new__() method. The two methods are equally appropriate for different use cases, and by following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can create Python classes that can only contain one instance at a time.
