singleton design patterns
=========================
1. Introduction to Singleton Design Pattern
The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that only one instance of an object is created and is shared across the entire application. This pattern is helpful in scenarios that require one global point of access, such as configuration files, resource managers, and logging.

2. Steps to Implement Singleton Design Pattern
Python has several ways of implementing Singleton Design Pattern. Here are some of the methods:

2.1 Singleton using a Module
The module can be used to implement Singleton design patterns in Python. Modules are Python files that have a .py extension. When imported, the module is initialized only once, and its variables become global. The module's contents are available throughout the application.

Here is an example of using a module approach:

```
filename: singleton_module.py
class Singleton:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def increment_count(self):
        self.count += 1    

singleton_instance = Singleton()
```

To access the Singleton instance, you only need to import the module into your Python code and use its contents, as demonstrated below:

```
from singleton_module import *
singleton_instance.increment_count()
```

2.2 Singleton using the __new__ method
One of the strengths of Python is that it is highly customizable. This method uses class instantiation to instantiate the class once and return the same instance every time the class is called. The __new__ method is the most natural way to create a Singleton instance.

Here is an example of using the __new__ method:

```
class Singleton:
    __instance = None
    def __new__(cls):
        if Singleton.__instance is None:
            Singleton.__instance = object.__new__(cls)
        return Singleton.__instance

    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def increment_count(self):
        self.count += 1    
```

To access the Singleton instance, you only need to create an object of the Singleton class. Since the class's __new__ method ensures that only one instance is created, you do not need to worry about creating multiple objects.

```
singleton_instance = Singleton()
singleton_instance.increment_count()
```

3. Conclusion

Python 3.10 offers multiple ways to implement the Singleton Design Pattern. You can use the __new__ method or a module approach to create a Singleton instance. By implementing the Singleton Design Pattern, you can guarantee that only one instance of an object is created and is shared among all the application components.
