decorators
==========
Introduction:
Decorators are the functions that take another function and extend the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. Functions in Python are first-class objects meaning that we can pass them as arguments to another function and return them as values from another function. This feature of Python programming language allows us to use decorators effectively and efficiently. 

In this course, we will learn how to create and use decorators in Python version 3.10.

Prerequisites:
To understand decorators, you should have an understanding of functions and function parameters. You should also be comfortable with defining and calling functions in Python.

Lesson 1: Defining a Decorator
To define a decorator, we use the @ symbol followed by the name of the decorator function. In this example code, we define a decorator function called my_decorator:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper
```

In this code, the my_decorator function takes another function func as its argument. It then defines an inner function called wrapper that adds some functionality before and after the func function is called. The my_decorator function returns the wrapper function which can be used to wrap any other function.

To use the decorator, we prepend the @my_decorator before the function that we want to decorate. Here is an example code to demonstrate this:

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
  print("Hello World!")

say_hello()
```

Output:
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello World!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

Lesson 2: Decorating Functions with Parameters
Sometimes you might want to decorate a function that takes one or more parameters. In this case, you need to define your wrapper function to take these parameters. Here is an example decorator code that decorates a function taking two parameters:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(x, y):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func(x, y)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper
```

To use this decorator, we apply the syntax @my_decorator to the new function we want to decorate, which now takes two parameters:

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello(x, y):
  print("Hello", x, y)

say_hello("John", "Smith")
```

Output:
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello John Smith
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

Lesson 3: Decorating Classes
You can also apply decorators to classes in Python. In this example, we will define a decorator that prints a message before and after any function call in a class:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func(self)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    @my_decorator
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello, my name is", self.name)

person1 = Person("John", 36)
person1.say_hello()
```

Output:
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello, my name is John
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

As shown, we apply the @my_decorator before the functions defined in the Person class.

Conclusion:
Decorators are a powerful Python feature that allows you to add additional behavior to your code without modifying it. They are useful for logging, authentication, and caching, to name just a few use cases.

This course has covered the basics of how to create and use decorators in Python 3.10. Now that you understand the concept of decorators, you can use them to write more readable and efficient code.
