destructors
===========
Introduction:

Destructors are special methods in Python that allow us to free up resources once an object is no longer needed. They are called before an object is destroyed and can be used, for example, to close files, release network connections or free up memory.

In this tutorial we will learn how to use destructors in Python version 3.10.

Prerequisites:

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- Python version 3.10 or later
- A code editor of your choice

Step by Step Instructions:

1. Create a simple class

First, we will create a simple class to use as an example throughout the tutorial:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        print('Creating instance of MyClass')

    def __del__(self):
        print('Destroying instance of MyClass')
```

This class has two methods:

- __init__ method is called when an instance of MyClass is created. It simply prints a message to the console.
- __del__ method is called when an instance of MyClass is destroyed. It also prints a message to the console.

2. Create an instance of MyClass

Now, let's create an instance of MyClass:

```python
obj = MyClass()
```

This will call the __init__ method of MyClass and print the message "Creating instance of MyClass" to the console.

3. Delete the instance of MyClass

To delete the instance of MyClass, we can simply use the del statement:

```python
del obj
```

This will call the __del__ method of MyClass and print the message "Destroying instance of MyClass" to the console.

4. Testing with multiple instances

Let's create multiple instances of MyClass:

```python
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()
```

This will create two instances of MyClass and call the __init__ method twice, printing the message "Creating instance of MyClass" twice to the console.

Now, let's delete one of the instances:

```python
del obj1
```

This will call the __del__ method of MyClass for the obj1 instance and print the message "Destroying instance of MyClass" to the console.

If we delete the remaining instance:

```python
del obj2
```

This will call the __del__ method of MyClass for the obj2 instance and print the message "Destroying instance of MyClass" to the console.

5. Using destructors with other resources

Destructors can be used to free up other resources as well. For example, let's create a class that opens and closes a file:

```python
class MyFile:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.file = open(filename, 'w')
        print('Creating instance of MyFile')

    def __del__(self):
        self.file.close()
        print('Destroying instance of MyFile')
```

This class has two methods:

- __init__ method opens a file in write mode and stores it in the file attribute. It also prints a message to the console.
- __del__ method closes the file and prints a message to the console.

Let's create an instance of MyFile:

```python
mf = MyFile('test.txt')
```

This will call the __init__ method of MyFile and open the 'test.txt' file in write mode. It will also print the message "Creating instance of MyFile" to the console.

Now, let's delete the instance of MyFile:

```python
del mf
```

This will call the __del__ method of MyFile and close the 'test.txt' file. It will also print the message "Destroying instance of MyFile" to the console.

Conclusion:

Destructors are a useful feature in Python that allow us to free up resources once an object is no longer needed. They are called before an object is destroyed and can be used to close files, release network connections or free up memory. In this tutorial, we learned how to use destructors in Python version 3.10 by creating a class with an __init__ and __del__ method, creating instances of the class, and deleting the instances to call the __del__ method.
