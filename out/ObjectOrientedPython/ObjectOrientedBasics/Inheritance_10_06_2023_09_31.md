inheritance
===========
Introduction

In object-oriented programming, inheritance refers to the ability to create a new class based on an existing class. The new class retains some or all of the characteristics of the original class, but can also add its own unique features. Python supports inheritance, which makes it easier to create reusable code.

In this course, we will learn how to use inheritance in Python version 3.10. We will start by understanding the basics of inheritance and then move on to creating subclasses and applying inheritance to real-world scenarios.

Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have a basic understanding of Python syntax and concepts, including classes and objects.

Understanding Inheritance

Inheritance is based on the idea of a parent and child relationship between classes. The parent class, also known as the superclass or base class, is the original class from which new classes are derived. The child class, also known as the subclass, is the new class that inherits properties and methods from the parent class.

The subclass can extend or modify the behavior of the parent class by adding or overriding methods, or by adding new methods and attributes. The parent class, however, remains unchanged and can be used as is, or can serve as a basis for creating multiple subclasses.

Creating a Subclass

To create a subclass, we use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the subclass, a parenthesis containing the name of the parent class, and a colon. For example:

```
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
```

This creates a new subclass called `ChildClass` that inherits from the `ParentClass`. Now we can add new methods and attributes to the `ChildClass`, as well as override or extend existing methods.

Overriding a Method

To override a method, we define a method with the same name as the parent class method in the subclass. For example:

```
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
  def method_name(self):
    # new implementation goes here
```

This replaces the implementation of the `method_name()` in the parent class with the new implementation in the child class.

Extending a Method

To extend a method, we define a new method in the subclass with a different name than the parent class method, but call the parent class method inside it. For example:

```
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
  def new_method_name(self):
    # do something new
    super().method_name()
    # do something else new
```

This calls the `method_name()` method in the parent class and adds new functionality before and after it.

Applying Inheritance in Real-World Scenarios

Inheritance can be used in many real-world scenarios, such as creating a hierarchy of classes for an animal kingdom. We can create a class called `Animal` as the parent class, and then create subclasses for specific types of animals, such as `Mammal`, `Reptile`, `Bird`, and so on.

Each subclass can inherit attributes and methods from the `Animal` class, such as `name`, `age`, and `gender`, but can also add its own unique characteristics, such as `fur_color`, `scales`, `feathers`, and so on.

We can also create methods in the `Animal` class that are common to all animals, such as `eat()`, `sleep()`, `move()`, and so on. Each subclass can then override or extend these methods to make them specific to that type of animal.

Conclusion

Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows us to create reusable code and create hierarchies of classes that reflect real-world relationships. In Python version 3.10, we can easily create subclasses that inherit from parent classes, override or extend methods, and apply inheritance in real-world scenarios.
