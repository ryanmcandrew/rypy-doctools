magic methods
=============
Introduction:
Magic methods in Python are a set of special methods that allow you to add some built-in functionalities and behaviors to your Python classes. These methods are indicated by double underscores before and after the method name, like __init__ and __str__.

In this course, we will learn how to use magic methods in Python version 3.10. We will cover the following topics:

1. __init__ method
2. __str__ method
3. __repr__ method
4. __len__ method
5. __getitem__ method
6. __setitem__ method
7. __delitem__ method
8. __contains__ method
9. Conclusion

1. __init__ method:
The __init__ method is the constructor method of a class in Python. It is called when the object of the class is created. The syntax of the __init__ method is as follows:

def __init__(self, arguments):
    # code to initialize the object

Here 'self' refers to the object being created, and 'arguments' are the parameters passed to the constructor method. Let's see an example to understand it better.

Example:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

Here, we create a class named 'Person' with an __init__ method that takes the 'name' and 'age' parameters and initializes them to the object. Now we can create objects of this class with the following code:

p1 = Person('John', 25)
p2 = Person('Mary', 30)

2. __str__ method:
The __str__ method is used to return a string representation of the object. The syntax of the __str__ method is as follows:

def __str__(self):
    # code to return the string representation

Here 'self' refers to the object whose string representation we want to get. Let's see an example to understand it better.

Example:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."

Here, we create a class named 'Person' with an __init__ method and a __str__ method that returns the name and age of the person. Now we can print the object of this class with the following code:

p1 = Person('John', 25)
print(p1) # John is 25 years old.

3. __repr__ method:
The __repr__ method is similar to the __str__ method, but it is used to return a string that represents the object's code itself. The syntax of the __repr__ method is as follows:

def __repr__(self):
    # code to return the string representation of the object's code

Here 'self' refers to the object whose code representation we want to get. Let's see an example to understand it better.

Example:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Person('{self.name}', {self.age})"

Here, we create a class named 'Person' with an __init__ method and a __repr__ method that returns the code representation of the object. Now we can print the object's code representation with the following code:

p1 = Person('John', 25)
print(repr(p1)) # Person('John', 25)

4. __len__ method:
The __len__ method is used to return the length of the object. The syntax of the __len__ method is as follows:

def __len__(self):
    # code to return the length of the object

Here 'self' refers to the object whose length we want to get. Let's see an example to understand it better.

Example:

class PersonList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.people = []

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.people)

Here, we create a class named 'PersonList' with an __init__ method and a __len__ method that returns the length of the 'people' list in the object. Now we can get the length of the object with the following code:

p_list = PersonList()
p_list.people.append(Person('John', 25))
p_list.people.append(Person('Mary', 30))
print(len(p_list)) # 2

5. __getitem__ method:
The __getitem__ method is used to get an item from the object with the help of an index. The syntax of the __getitem__ method is as follows:

def __getitem__(self, index):
    # code to get the item with the given index

Here 'self' refers to the object whose item we want to get, and 'index' is the index of the item. Let's see an example to understand it better.

Example:

class PersonList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.people = []

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.people[index]

Here, we create a class named 'PersonList' with an __init__ method and a __getitem__ method that returns the person at the given index. Now we can get the item from the object with the following code:

p_list = PersonList()
p_list.people.append(Person('John', 25))
p_list.people.append(Person('Mary', 30))
print(p_list[0]) # John is 25 years old.

6. __setitem__ method:
The __setitem__ method is used to set an item in the object with the help of an index. The syntax of the __setitem__ method is as follows:

def __setitem__(self, index, value):
    # code to set the item with the given index to the given value

Here 'self' refers to the object whose item we want to set, 'index' is the index of the item, and 'value' is the value to be set. Let's see an example to understand it better.

Example:

class PersonList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.people = []

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.people[index]

    def __setitem__(self, index, value):
        self.people[index] = value

Here, we create a class named 'PersonList' with an __init__ method, a __getitem__ method, and a __setitem__ method that sets the person at the given index to the given value. Now we can set the item in the object with the following code:

p_list = PersonList()
p_list.people.append(Person('John', 25))
p_list[0] = Person('Mary', 30)
print(p_list[0]) # Mary is 30 years old.

7. __delitem__ method:
The __delitem__ method is used to delete an item from the object with the help of an index. The syntax of the __delitem__ method is as follows:

def __delitem__(self, index):
    # code to delete the item with the given index

Here 'self' refers to the object whose item we want to delete, and 'index' is the index of the item. Let's see an example to understand it better.

Example:

class PersonList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.people = []

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.people[index]

    def __setitem__(self, index, value):
        self.people[index] = value

    def __delitem__(self, index):
        del self.people[index]

Here, we create a class named 'PersonList' with an __init__ method, a __getitem__ method, a __setitem__ method, and a __delitem__ method that deletes the person at the given index. Now we can delete the item from the object with the following code:

p_list = PersonList()
p_list.people.append(Person('John', 25))
del p_list[0]
print(len(p_list)) # 0

8. __contains__ method:
The __contains__ method is used to check if an item exists in the object or not. The syntax of the __contains__ method is as follows:

def __contains__(self, value):
    # return True if the value exists in the object, else False

Here 'self' refers to the object in which we want to check the existence of the given value. Let's see an example to understand it better.

Example:

class PersonList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.people = []

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.people[index]

    def __setitem__(self, index, value):
        self.people[index] = value

    def __delitem__(self, index):
        del self.people[index]

    def __contains__(self, value):
        return value in self.people

Here, we create a class named 'PersonList' with an __init__ method, a __getitem__ method, a __setitem__ method, a __delitem__ method, and a __contains__ method that checks if the person exists in the list or not. Now we can check if the value exists in the object with the following code:

p_list = PersonList()
p_list.people.append(Person('John', 25))
print(Person('John', 25) in p_list) # True

Conclusion:

In this course, we covered the magic methods in Python version 3.10. We learned how to use the __init__ method for constructor, __str__ and __repr__ methods for string representations, __len__ method for length, __getitem__, __setitem__, and __delitem__ methods for sequence operations, and __contains__ method for containment tests. Now you can use these magic methods to enhance the functionality of your Python class.
