polymorphism
============
Introduction:

Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different ways. This feature enables the programmer to write code that is more flexible, adaptable, and reusable. In Python, polymorphism is implemented using classes, and it allows for a variety of different operations to be performed on objects of different types.

This how-to course will cover the basics of using polymorphism in Python version 3.10.

Prerequisites:

- Knowledge of basic Python syntax and object-oriented programming concepts
- Python version 3.10 installed on your computer

Step 1: Creating the Parent Class

In Python, polymorphism is implemented using classes. The first step is to create a parent class that defines the common method(s) that will be used by the child classes.

For example, let's create a class called `Animal` that has a method called `speak`.

```
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass
```

This class defines a method called `speak`, but the method does nothing yet. The `pass` keyword is used to indicate that the method is empty and does not perform any actions.

Step 2: Creating the Child Classes

The next step is to create child classes that inherit from the parent class. These classes will implement the `speak` method in their own unique way.

Let's create two child classes called `Dog` and `Cat`.

```
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"
```

These classes inherit from the `Animal` class and define their own `speak` method. When called, the `speak` method of a `Dog` object will return "Woof!", and the `speak` method of a `Cat` object will return "Meow!".

Step 3: Using Polymorphism

Now that we have created a parent class and two child classes, we can use polymorphism to call the `speak` method on each object.

```
def speak_animal(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

speak_animal(dog)  # Output: Woof!
speak_animal(cat)  # Output: Meow!
```

The `speak_animal` function takes an object of type `Animal` as input. When called with a `Dog` object, the `speak` method of the `Dog` class is called and returns "Woof!". Similarly, when called with a `Cat` object, the `speak` method of the `Cat` class is called and returns "Meow!".

This demonstrates how polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different ways.

Conclusion:

Polymorphism is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows for code that is more flexible, adaptable, and reusable. In Python, polymorphism is implemented using classes and enables different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. By creating parent and child classes and using the `super` keyword, you can take advantage of this feature and write more efficient and dynamic code.
