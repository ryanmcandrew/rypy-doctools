==============================
Introduction to Private Methods and Attributes in Python 3.10

In Python, the concept of private methods and attributes is handled using convention rather than true encapsulation mechanisms. Private methods and attributes are not accessible outside the class. Conventionally, we use a single underscore (_) to indicate that methods and attributes are not meant to be accessed outside the class. However, this is just a naming convention and can still be accessed from outside the class.

In Python 3.10, there is a new syntax for defining a true private attribute or method, where we use double underscores (__) before the attribute or method name. This will cause the name to be mangled, and it will not be accessible from outside the class.

In this course, we will learn how to use both conventions and true private methods and attributes in Python 3.10.

Lesson 1: Understanding Private Methods and Attributes in Python

In this lesson, we will learn about private methods and attributes in Python. We will understand why they are essential and how they are implemented using conventions and true private methods and attributes in Python 3.10.

- Private Methods and Attributes
- What are Private Methods and Attributes?
- Implementing Private Methods and Attributes Using Conventions
- Limitations of Using Conventions
- Implementing True Private Methods and Attributes in Python 3.10

Lesson 2: Using Convention to Define Private Methods and Attributes

In this lesson, we will learn how to use conventions to define private methods and attributes in Python. We will also discuss the limitations of using conventions.

Lesson 3: Using True Private Methods and Attributes in Python 3.10

In this lesson, we will learn how to use true private methods and attributes in Python 3.10. We will understand the syntax required to define true private methods and attributes, and we will learn how to use them inside and outside the class.

- Syntax for Defining True Private Methods and Attributes
- How to Call True Private Methods and Attributes
- Understanding Name Mangling
- Limitations of Using True Private Methods and Attributes

Lesson 4: Best Practices for Using Private Methods and Attributes

In this lesson, we will learn about some best practices for using private methods and attributes in Python. We will understand when it is appropriate to use private methods and attributes, and we will learn how to avoid some common pitfalls when using them.
