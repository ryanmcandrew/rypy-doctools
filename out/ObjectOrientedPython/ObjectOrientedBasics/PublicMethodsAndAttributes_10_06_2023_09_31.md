public methods and attributes
=============================
Introduction:
In Python, public methods and attributes are used to define the properties and behaviors of objects in a class. Public methods and attributes are visible to all the objects of the class and can be accessed by the user. In this how-to course, we will be covering the basics of public methods and attributes, and how to use them in Python 3.10.

Step 1: What are public methods and attributes?
Public methods and attributes are the properties and behaviors that are accessible by all the objects of a class. In Python, every object has some attributes and methods associated with it. These attributes and methods can either be private or public. Private attributes and methods are only visible to the object and cannot be accessed by any other object. On the other hand, public attributes and methods can be accessed by any object of the class.

Step 2: Defining public methods and attributes
To define a public method in a class, we use the 'def' keyword followed by the name of the method and its arguments (if any). For example:
```
class MyClass:
  def my_public_method(self):
    print("This is a public method")
```
In the above example, we have defined a public method called "my_public_method" in the class "MyClass". The method takes in an object of the class as argument and prints a string to the console.

Similarly, to define a public attribute in a class, we simply create a variable inside the class body. For example:
```
class MyClass:
  my_public_attribute = "This is a public attribute"
```
In the above example, we have defined a public attribute called "my_public_attribute" in the class "MyClass". The attribute is a string.

Step 3: Accessing public methods and attributes
To access a public method or attribute of an object, we simply use the dot notation. For example:
```
class MyClass:
  my_public_attribute = "This is a public attribute"
  
  def my_public_method(self):
    print("This is a public method")

# create an object of the class
obj = MyClass()

# accessing the public attribute
print(obj.my_public_attribute)

# accessing the public method
obj.my_public_method()
```
In the above example, we have created an object of the class "MyClass" and accessed its public attribute and method using the dot notation.

Step 4: Conclusion
In this how-to course, we have covered the basics of public methods and attributes in Python 3.10. We have learned how to define public methods and attributes in a class, and how to access them using the dot notation. Public methods and attributes are important concepts in Python programming and are used extensively in object-oriented programming.
