linked-lists
============
Introduction:

Linked-lists are popular data structures used in programming which can be used to store and manage large sets of data. They are similar to arrays, but unlike arrays, elements in linked-lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Linked-lists consist of nodes that contain data and a reference to the next node in the list. In this course, we will take a look at how to use linked-lists in Python version 3.10.

Step 1: Creating a Node class

In order to create a linked-list, we first need to define a Node class that will hold the data and the pointer/reference to the next node. The code for the Node class can be written as follows:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next_node = None
```

This class will allow us to create nodes with data values and a reference to the next node.

Step 2: Creating a Linked List class

The second step in creating a linked-list is to define a Linked List class that will create the linked-list by holding references to the head and tail nodes. The head node will always be the first node in the list, while the tail node will be the last node. The following code shows the Linked List class definition:

```
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
```

In this code, we have defined two instance variables `self.head` and `self.tail` which hold the references to the first and last nodes in the list.

Step 3: Adding elements to the list

Once we have defined the Node and Linked List classes, we can start adding nodes to the list. The `add_node` method is used to add nodes to the list. The code for the `add_node` method is as follows:

```
class LinkedList:
    ...
    def add_node(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            self.tail.next_node = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
```

In this code, we have created a new `Node` with the data value passed to the method. If the head node is `None`, we assign the new node to both the head and tail references. Otherwise, we add the new node as the next node to the tail node and then update the tail reference to point to the new node.

Step 4: Traversing the list

Now that we have added nodes to the list, we can traverse the list to access the nodes in the list. We can do this using a `get_all_nodes` method, which will traverse the list and return all the nodes in the list. The code for the `get_all_nodes` method is as follows:

```
class LinkedList:
    ...
    def get_all_nodes(self):
        nodes = []
        current_node = self.head
        while current_node is not None:
            nodes.append(current_node.data)
            current_node = current_node.next_node
        return nodes
```

In this code, we have initialized an empty `nodes` list and a `current_node` reference that points to the head node. We then use a while loop to iterate through the list until we reach the last node. At each iteration, we append the data in the current node to the `nodes` list and then update the `current_node` reference to point to the next node in the list. Finally, we return the `nodes` list.

Step 5: Removing elements from the list

To remove an element from the list, we define a `remove_node` method. The code for this method is as follows:

```
class LinkedList:
    ...
    def remove_node(self, data):
        current_node = self.head
        previous_node = None
        while current_node is not None:
            if current_node.data == data:
                if previous_node is None:
                    self.head = current_node.next_node
                else:
                    previous_node.next_node = current_node.next_node
                return True
            else:
                previous_node = current_node
                current_node = current_node.next_node
        return False
```

In this code, we initialize two references `previous_node` and `current_node`, to keep track of the previous and current nodes. We use a while loop to iterate through the list and search for the node with the data value passed to the method. When a match is found, we need to update the references such that the previous node's `next_node` reference is updated to point to the next node in the list, skipping over the current node that we want to remove. If the match is found for the head node, we need to update the head reference to point to the next node and return True. If the match is not found, we continue iterating through the list until the last node is reached, and then return False.

Conclusion:

In this course, we have learned how to implement linked-lists in Python version 3.10. We have defined a Node class that holds the data and reference to the next node, and a Linked List class that manages the head and tail references and also contains the add, remove, and get all nodes methods. We hope you find this course useful and that it helps you understand how linked-lists work in Python.
