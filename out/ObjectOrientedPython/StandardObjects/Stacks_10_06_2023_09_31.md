Introduction:

Storing data in a structured manner is a key aspect of programming. One basic data structure in Python is the stack. A stack is defined as a collection of elements, where the elements are only added or removed in a specific order. The most recently added element is always at the top of the stack, and the oldest element is at the bottom of the stack. This data structure follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This tutorial will teach you how to use stacks in Python 3.10.

Lesson 1: Creating a stack in Python

To start using a stack in Python 3.10, you need to import the 'stack' module from the 'collections' library. Then use the code below to create an empty stack.

```
from collections import deque
stack = deque()
```

In the code, 'deque' is a class in the 'collections' library that represents a double-ended queue, which is used to create the stack. The stack is created as an empty deque object.

Lesson 2: Adding elements to a stack

To add elements to the stack, use the 'append()' function. This function adds elements to the top of the stack.

```
stack.append('element')
```

In the code above, 'element' is the data that will be added to the top of the stack.

Lesson 3: Removing elements from a stack

To remove an element from the stack, use the 'pop()' function. This function removes the topmost element from the stack and returns the removed element.

```
element = stack.pop()
```

In the code above, 'element' is a variable that stores the value of the popped element.

Lesson 4: Checking the topmost element in a stack

To check the topmost element in a stack, use the '[-1]' operator. This operator returns the last element in the stack, which is the topmost element.

```
top_element = stack[-1]
```

In the code above, 'top_element' is a variable that stores the value of the topmost element in the stack.

Lesson 5: Checking the size of a stack

To check the size of a stack, use the 'len()' function. This function returns the number of elements in the stack.

```
size = len(stack)
```

In the code above, 'size' is a variable that stores the number of elements in the stack.

Lesson 6: Checking if a stack is empty

To check if a stack is empty, use the 'not' operator with the 'bool()' function. This operator returns True if the stack is empty, and False if the stack contains elements.

```
is_empty = not bool(stack)
```

In the code above, 'is_empty' is a variable that stores True if the stack is empty and False if the stack contains elements.

Conclusion:

In this tutorial, you learned how to create a stack in Python 3.10, add and remove elements from a stack, check the topmost element in a stack, check the size of a stack, and check if a stack is empty. Using stacks in programming will enable you to store and manipulate data in an organized way, which is essential for many tasks and algorithms.
