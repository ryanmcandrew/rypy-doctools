Introduction:

PowerShell is a command-line interface (CLI) which allows users to interact with the Windows operating system. PowerShell comes with an interactive interpreter that enables the execution of PowerShell scripts and commands. Python version 3.10 also has an interactive interpreter that can be used to execute Python scripts and commands. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the interpreter in PowerShell to execute Python scripts and commands.

Step 1: Verify that Python version 3.10 is installed on your computer

To use the interpreter in PowerShell to execute Python scripts, you will need to have Python version 3.10 installed on your computer. If you do not have Python version 3.10 installed on your computer, you can download and install it from the official Python website.

To verify that Python version 3.10 is installed on your computer:

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Type 'python --version' and press enter.
3. If Python version 3.10 is installed, the version number will be displayed.

Step 2: Launch the Python interpreter

To launch the Python interpreter in PowerShell:

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Type 'python' and press enter.

Once you have launched the Python interpreter, you can type Python commands and scripts, and they will be executed immediately.

Step 3: Using the interpreter in PowerShell to execute Python scripts

If you have a Python script that you want to execute in PowerShell, you can do so by running the Python script in the PowerShell command prompt. To execute a Python script from the PowerShell command prompt:

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Type 'python <path-to-python-script>' and press enter.
3. The Python script will be executed and the output will be displayed in the PowerShell console.

Here is an example of how to execute a Python script in PowerShell:

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
3. Type 'python example_script.py' and press enter.
4. The Python script will be executed and the output will be displayed in the PowerShell console.

Step 4: Exiting the interpreter

To exit the interpreter, type 'exit()' or press 'Ctrl + D.'
