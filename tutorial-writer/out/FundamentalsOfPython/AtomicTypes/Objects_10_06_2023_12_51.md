Introduction:

Python is an object-oriented programming language that encourages code reusability and modular design. Objects are one of the main building blocks in Python's object-oriented programming paradigm. This course will provide an introduction to objects in Python version 3.10. You will learn how to create objects, access their methods and attributes, and implement inheritance.

Prerequisites:

To start with this course, you need to have some basic knowledge about Python programming language, data types, functions, and control structures.

Chapter 1: Creating Objects

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that relies on objects and their interactions to solve problems. We can create a class in Python that defines the attributes and methods of a specific type of object. Here's how to create an object in Python:

1. Define the class - When you create an object, the first step is to define the class that the object is an instance of.

```
class Person:
  pass
```

In this example, we've created a `Person` class that doesn't actually do anything yet, but it's enough to create an object.

2. Create the object - To create an object, we use the name of the class followed by parentheses.

```
person1 = Person()
```

In this case, we've created a `person1` object that is an instance of our `Person` class.

3. Define attributes - An object's attributes are the characteristics that define it, like a person's name or age. We can define these by adding them to the class definition.

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
```

Here, we've defined the `name` and `age` attributes in the `__init__()` method.

4. Access attributes - To access an object's attributes, we use dot notation.

```
print(person1.name)
```

This will output the `name` attribute of our `Person` object.

Chapter 2: Using Methods

An object's methods are the functions that it can perform. We can define methods in our class definition to give our objects functionality. Here's how to define and use methods in Python:

1. Define methods - Just like with attributes, we can define methods in our class definition.

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  
  def say_hello(self):
    print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}!")
```

In this example, we've defined a `say_hello()` method for our `Person` class that will output a greeting with the person's name.

2. Call methods - To call an object's method, we use dot notation followed by the method name and parentheses.

```
person1.say_hello()
```

This will call our `say_hello()` method on the `person1` object and output the greeting.

Chapter 3: Access Modifiers

Access modifiers are used to control the access to a class's attributes and methods. By default, all attributes and methods are public in Python, but we can use access modifiers to restrict access to certain parts of our code. Here's how to use access modifiers in Python:

1. Public - Public attributes and methods are accessible from anywhere in our code. There is no need to specify an access modifier for public members.

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  
  def say_hello(self):
    print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}!")
```

In this example, the `name` and `age` attributes and the `say_hello()` method are all public.

2. Private - Private attributes and methods are only accessible from inside the class definition. We can make a member private by using a double underscore prefix.

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.__name = name
    self.__age = age
  
  def say_hello(self):
    print(f"Hello, my name is {self.__name}!")
```

In this example, the `name` and `age` attributes are now private and can only be accessed from inside the `Person` class definition.

3. Protected - Protected attributes and methods are accessible from inside the class definition as well as its subclasses. We can make a member protected by using a single underscore prefix.

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self._name = name
    self._age = age
  
  def say_hello(self):
    print(f"Hello, my name is {self._name}!")
```

In this example, the `name` and `age` attributes are now protected and can be accessed from the `Person` class definition as well as its subclasses.

Chapter 4: Inheritance

Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows us to create new classes based on existing ones. The new class will inherit all the attributes and methods of the existing class, and we can also add new ones or override existing ones. Here's how to use inheritance in Python:

1. Define the parent class - We first define the existing class that we want to derive a new class from.

```
class Animal:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
  
  def speak(self):
    pass
```

In this example, we've defined an `Animal` class with an `__init__()` method to set the `name` attribute and a `speak()` method that doesn't actually do anything yet.

2. Define the child class - We then define the new class that will inherit from the parent class.

```
class Dog(Animal):
  def speak(self):
    print("Woof!")
```

In this example, we've defined a `Dog` class that inherits from the `Animal` class and overrides the `speak()` method to output "Woof!".

3. Create objects - We can now create objects of both classes.

```
animal1 = Animal("Animal")
dog1 = Dog("Fido")
```

`animal1` is an object of the `Animal` class, while `dog1` is an object of the `Dog` class.

4. Access methods - We can call the `speak()` method on both objects.

```
animal1.speak()
dog1.speak()
```

This will output nothing for `animal1` and "Woof!" for `dog1`.

Conclusion:

This course should give you a good introduction to objects in Python version 3.10. By now, you should have a good understanding of how to create objects, access their methods and attributes, and implement inheritance.
