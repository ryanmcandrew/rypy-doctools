addition and subtraction
========================
Introduction:

Python is a popular high-level programming language that can be used for various applications. It is easy to learn and can be used for simple and complex computations including addition and subtraction. In this course, we will cover how you can use the addition and subtraction operators in Python version 3.10 to perform arithmetic operations.

Prerequisites:

Before we begin, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming language and basic programming concepts.

Lesson 1: Addition in Python

In Python, the addition operator (+) is used to perform arithmetic addition. The operator takes two operands and returns the sum of the operands.

Example:

a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)

This code assigns 10 to the variable a and 20 to the variable b, it adds the two variables using the plus (+) operator and assigns the result to variable c. The code then prints the value of c. The output of this code will be 30.

Lesson 2: Subtraction in Python

In Python, the subtraction operator (-) is used to perform arithmetic subtraction. The operator takes two operands and returns the difference between the operands.

Example:

a = 20
b = 10
c = a - b
print(c)

This code assigns 20 to the variable a and 10 to the variable b, it subtracts the value of b from a using the minus (-) operator and assigns the result to variable c. The code then prints the value of c. The output of this code will be 10.

Lesson 3: Using arithmetic operators in conditional statements

In Python, arithmetic operators like + and – can also be used in conditional statements such as if statements. This allows you to perform a certain action based on the result of the arithmetic operation.

Example:

a = 10
b = 20
if (a + b) > 30:
   print("The sum is greater than 30")
else:
   print("The sum is less than or equal to 30")

In this code, the if statement checks if the sum of a and b is greater than 30 using the plus (+) operator. If the sum is greater than 30, the code prints “The sum is greater than 30”. However, if the sum is less than or equal to 30, the code prints “The sum is less than or equal to 30”.

Conclusion:

In this course, we have covered how to use addition and subtraction operators in Python version 3.10 for performing arithmetic operations. Using these operators, you can perform simple and complex computations in your Python programs. It is important to note that you can use these operators in if statements to perform an action based on the result of the arithmetic operation.
