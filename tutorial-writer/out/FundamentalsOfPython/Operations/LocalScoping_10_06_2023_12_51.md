local scoping
=============
Note: This course assumes basic knowledge of Python programming.

Python 3.10 introduces the concept of local scoping. In previous versions of Python, any variable that is assigned a value within a function is automatically considered a local variable. However, in Python 3.10, you can now explicitly define variables as local using the "local" keyword.

In this course, we'll explore how to use local scoping in Python version 3.10.

Lesson 1: Defining Local Variables

To define a local variable, you simply use the "local" keyword before the variable name. Here's an example:

def my_func():
    local_var = "This is a local variable"
    
In the example above, "local_var" is now a local variable and can only be accessed within the "my_func" function.

Lesson 2: Accessing Local Variables

As mentioned earlier, local variables can only be accessed within the function in which they are defined. If you try to access a local variable outside of the function, you'll receive a "NameError" message. Here's an example:

def my_func():
    local_var = "This is a local variable"
    
print(local_var)

When you run the code above, you'll see the following error message: "NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined". This is because "local_var" can only be accessed within the "my_func" function.

Lesson 3: Global Variables vs. Local Variables

One important thing to note about local variables is that they are independent of global variables. This means that you can have a local variable with the same name as a global variable, and they won't interfere with each other. Here's an example:

my_global_var = "This is a global variable"

def my_func():
    local_var = "This is a local variable"
    print(local_var)
    print(my_global_var)

my_func()
print(my_global_var)

In the example above, "my_global_var" is a global variable that can be accessed anywhere in the code. "local_var" is a local variable that can only be accessed within the "my_func" function. When we call the "my_func" function, both "local_var" and "my_global_var" are printed to the console. However, when we call "my_global_var" outside of the function, only the global variable is printed to the console.

Lesson 4: Modifying Local Variables

Local variables can be modified within the function in which they are defined. However, the modified value of the variable won't be available outside of the function. Here's an example:

def my_func():
    local_var = "This is a local variable"
    print(local_var)
    local_var = "This is a modified local variable"
    print(local_var)

my_func()

In the example above, "local_var" is first defined as "This is a local variable". It's then modified within the function and printed to the console as "This is a modified local variable". However, if you try to access "local_var" outside of the function, you'll still receive a "NameError" message.

Lesson 5: Using Local Scoping for Optimization

Local scoping can also be used for optimization purposes. When a function is called, Python has to search for the variable within the local scope, then the global scope, and finally the built-in scope. This search process can be time-consuming, especially for large programs. However, if you use local scoping to explicitly define the scope of each variable, you can significantly reduce the search time and improve the performance of your code.

To summarize, local scoping in Python version 3.10 allows you to define variables as local within functions. Local variables can only be accessed within the function in which they are defined, and they are independent of global variables. Local variables can be modified within the function, but their modified value won't be available outside of the function. Finally, local scoping can be used for optimization purposes.
