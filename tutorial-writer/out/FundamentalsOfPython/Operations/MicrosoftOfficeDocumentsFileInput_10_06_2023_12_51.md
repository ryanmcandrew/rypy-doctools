microsoft office documents file input
=====================================
Note: To complete this course, you will need to have basic knowledge of Python language and Microsoft Office applications.

Introduction:

Python is a powerful programming language that can be used to automate tasks with Microsoft Office packages. In this course, we will learn how to work with Microsoft Office documents using Python version 3.10. We will focus on file input and extraction, which will involve reading, editing, and writing contents to Microsoft Office files.

Step 1: Install Python Libraries

To work with Microsoft Office documents in Python, we need to install some libraries. To do this, open the command prompt or terminal and type the following command.

```
$ pip install python-docx
$ pip install xlrd
$ pip install openpyxl
```

These libraries will allow us to work with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents, respectively.

Step 2: Import Libraries

After installing the required libraries, we need to import them into our Python script. For this course, we will focus on Word and Excel files only, so we will import python-docx and openpyxl libraries.

```python
import docx
import openpyxl
```

Step 3: Read Word Document

To read a Microsoft Word document, we need to create an object of the docx.Document class. Then, we can access the contents of the document using its properties and methods.

```python
doc = docx.Document('my_word_file.docx')

# Accessing Paragraphs
for para in doc.paragraphs:
    print(para.text)

# Accessing Tables
for table in doc.tables:
    for row in table.rows:
        for cell in row.cells:
            print(cell.text)
```

Step 4: Read Excel Document

To read a Microsoft Excel document, we need to create an object of the openpyxl.load_workbook class. Then, we can access the contents of the workbook using its properties and methods.

```python
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('my_excel_file.xlsx')

# Accessing Sheets
for sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:
    sheet = wb[sheet_name]
    print(sheet_name)

# Accessing Rows and Cells
for row in sheet.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=5):
    for cell in row:
        print(cell.value)
```

Step 5: Edit Word Document

To edit a Microsoft Word document, we need to access its paragraphs and tables and change their contents using the properties and methods of the docx.Document class.

```python
doc = docx.Document('my_word_file.docx')

# Editing Paragraphs
for para in doc.paragraphs:
    if 'Python' in para.text:
        para.text = para.text.replace('Python', 'Java')

# Editing Tables
for table in doc.tables:
    for row in table.rows:
        for cell in row.cells:
            if 'API' in cell.text:
                cell.text = cell.text.replace('API', 'SDK')

doc.save('my_edited_word_file.docx')
```

Step 6: Edit Excel Document

To edit a Microsoft Excel document, we need to access its cells and change their contents using the properties and methods of the openpyxl.Workbook class.

```python
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('my_excel_file.xlsx')

# Editing Cells
sheet = wb['Sheet1']
for row in sheet.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=5):
    for cell in row:
        if cell.value == 'Python':
            cell.value = 'Java'

wb.save('my_edited_excel_file.xlsx')
```

Step 7: Write Word Document

To create a Microsoft Word document from scratch, we need to create an instance of the docx.Document class and add paragraphs and tables to it. We can then save the new document using the save() method.

```python
doc = docx.Document()

# Adding Paragraphs
doc.add_paragraph('Introduction to Python Programming')
doc.add_paragraph('Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.')

# Adding Tables
table = doc.add_table(rows=2, cols=2)
cell1 = table.cell(0, 0)
cell2 = table.cell(0, 1)
cell3 = table.cell(1, 0)
cell4 = table.cell(1, 1)
cell1.text = 'Item'
cell2.text = 'Quantity'
cell3.text = 'Apple'
cell4.text = '3'

doc.save('my_new_word_file.docx')
```

Step 8: Write Excel Document

To create a Microsoft Excel document from scratch, we need to create an instance of the openpyxl.Workbook class and add sheets and cells to it. We can then save the new workbook using the save() method.

```python
wb = openpyxl.Workbook()

# Adding Sheets
sheet1 = wb.create_sheet('Sheet1')
sheet2 = wb.create_sheet('Sheet2')

# Adding Cells
sheet1['A1'] = 'Item'
sheet1['B1'] = 'Quantity'
sheet1['A2'] = 'Apple'
sheet1['B2'] = 3

wb.save('my_new_excel_file.xlsx')
```

Conclusion:

In this course, we have learned how to work with Microsoft Office documents using Python version 3.10. We have covered file input and extraction, as well as editing and writing new files. With these skills, you can automate repetitive tasks and work more efficiently with Microsoft Office packages.
