=========
Introduction:

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. In Python, import statement is used to import a module into a program file. This allows you to reuse code in an organized and efficient way. The import statement is one of the most commonly used statements in Python. In this tutorial, we will learn about import statements in Python version 3.10.

Import Statement:

The import statement in Python is used to load modules into a program. The import statement can be used to import either a single module or multiple modules.

Syntax:

The syntax of the import statement is as follows:

```
import module_name
```

Or

```
import module_name1, module_name2
```

Or

```
import module_name as alias_name
```

Or

```
from module_name import function_name
```

Or

```
from module_name import function_name1, function_name2
```

Or 

```
from module_name import function_name as alias_name
```

Examples:

Letâ€™s look into some examples for each type of import statement in Python version 3.10.

1. Importing a single module:

To import a single module in Python, we use the import statement followed by the module name.

```python
# program using import statement in Python
# importing a single module
 
import math
 
print(math.pi)
print(math.sqrt(25))
```

Output:

```
3.141592653589793
5.0
```

In the above program, we are importing the math module and using the pi and sqrt functions provided in the module.

2. Importing multiple modules:

We can also import multiple modules in a single import statement by separating the module names with commas.

```python
# program using import statement in Python
# importing multiple modules in a single statement
 
import math, random
 
print(math.pi)
print(random.randint(1, 100))
```

Output:

```
3.141592653589793
44
```

In the above program, we have imported the math and random modules, and used the pi function from the math module and randint function from the random module.

3. Aliasing a module:

We can use the as keyword to provide an alias name to the imported module.

```python
# program using import statement in Python
# aliasing a module
 
import math as m
 
print(m.pi)
```

Output:

```
3.141592653589793
```

In the above program, we have imported the math module and given it a short name m using the as keyword.

4. Importing a function from a module:

We can also import only specific functions from a module using the from keyword.

```python
# program using import statement in Python
# importing a specific function from a module
 
from math import pi
 
print(pi)
```

Output:

```
3.141592653589793
```

In the above program, we have imported only the pi function from the math module using the from and import keywords.

5. Importing multiple functions from a module:

We can also import multiple functions from a module using the from keyword.

```python
# program using import statement in Python
# importing multiple functions from a module
 
from math import pi, sqrt
 
print(pi)
print(sqrt(25))
```

Output:

```
3.141592653589793
5.0
```

In the above program, we have imported the pi and sqrt functions from the math module using the from and import keywords.

6. Aliasing a function:

We can also provide an alias to the imported function using the as keyword.

```python
# program using import statement in Python
# aliasing a function
 
from math import sqrt as s
 
print(s(25))
```

Output:

```
5.0
```

In the above program, we have imported the sqrt function from the math module and given it an alias name s using the as keyword.

Conclusion:

Hence, we have learned about the different import statements available in Python version 3.10 and how to use them with examples. These import statements are useful in reusing code and making the code more organized.
