Levenstein Distance
===================
Lesson 1: Introduction to Levenstein Distance

Levenstein Distance is a metric used to calculate the difference between two strings. A metric is a measure of distance that can be used to compare different entities. In the case of Levenstein Distance, the entities are two strings.

The Levenstein Distance is also known as the Edit Distance because it calculates the minimum number of operations (insertion, deletion, substitution) required to transform one string into another.

Lesson 2: Installing the Python Package

Before we can use Levenstein Distance in Python, we need to install the necessary package. The package is called "python-Levenshtein" and can be installed using pip. Open up your terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install python-Levenshtein
```

This will install the package on your computer and you can now proceed to use Levenstein Distance.

Lesson 3: Using Levenstein Distance in Python

In Python, we can use the Levenstein Distance function from the python-Levenshtein package. To start, we need to import the package using the following statement:

```
import Levenshtein
```

Now that the package is imported, we can use the Levenstein Distance function called "distance" to compare two strings. The function takes two arguments, the first being the first string, and the second being the second string. For example:

```
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "Hola"
distance = Levenshtein.distance(string1, string2)
print(distance)
```

This code will output "4" because it takes 4 operations (2 insertions and 2 substitutions) to transform "Hello" into "Hola".

Lesson 4: Advanced Features

The Levenstein Distance function in the python-Levenshtein package also has advanced features that allow us to calculate the distance between multiple strings and even ignore certain characters. Here are some examples:

```
# Distance between 3 strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "Hola"
string3 = "Bonjour"
distances = [Levenshtein.distance(string1, string2), Levenshtein.distance(string1, string3), Levenshtein.distance(string2, string3)]
print(distances) # Outputs [4, 6, 6]

# Ignoring certain characters
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "H3llo"
distance = Levenshtein.distance(string1, string2, substitute_costs=(("", ""),))
print(distance) # Outputs 0 because the substitution of H and 3 is ignored

```

These advanced features can be useful in situations where we need to compare multiple strings or ignore certain characters when comparing strings.

Lesson 5: Conclusion

In this course, we learned about the Levenstein Distance metric and how to use it in Python using the python-Levenshtein package. We also learned about some advanced features that can be used to calculate the distance between multiple strings or ignore certain characters. With this knowledge, we can now use Levenstein Distance in our Python projects to compare strings and measure their similarity.
