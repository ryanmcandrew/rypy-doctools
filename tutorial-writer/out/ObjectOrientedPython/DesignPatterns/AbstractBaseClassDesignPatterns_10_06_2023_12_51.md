abstract base class design patterns
===================================
Introduction:

Abstract base classes (ABCs) are design patterns used to facilitate a common design for multiple classes. They provide a way to define a set of methods that any class inheriting from it MUST implement. In Python, ABCs are defined using the `abc` module.

In this course, you will learn how to use ABCs in Python 3.10 to implement the common design pattern. You will learn how to design and implement the abstract base classes and how to use them to enforce a common interface for multiple classes.

Prerequisites:

Before starting this course, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Lesson 1: Introduction to abstract base classes

Abstract base classes (ABCs) are a way to enforce a common API across a set of subclasses. They define a set of methods that any class inheriting from it MUST implement.

To create an abstract base class, you can use the `abc` module. The `abc.ABC` class can be used as a base class for any other abstract base class. 

For example, let's create an abstract base class that defines a method called `draw()`:

```
import abc

class Shape(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass
```

The `@abc.abstractmethod` decorator indicates that `draw()` is an abstract method that MUST be implemented in any subclass of `Shape`.

Lesson 2: Creating concrete classes that inherit from an abstract base class

To create a concrete class that inherits from `Shape`, you simply implement the `draw()` method:

```
class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Circle")

class Square(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Square")
```

Now, you can create instances of `Circle` and `Square` and call the `draw()` method:

```
c = Circle()
c.draw() # Output: "Circle"

s = Square()
s.draw() # Output: "Square"
```

Lesson 3: Enforcing the common API across multiple classes

The real power of ABCs comes into play when you want to enforce a common API across multiple classes. You can define a set of abstract methods in an ABC and then ensure that each concrete subclass implements those methods.

For example, let's create an abstract base class called `Animal` that defines a set of abstract methods that any subclass MUST implement:

```
class Animal(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def eat(self):
        pass
    
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def sleep(self):
        pass
    
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass
```

Now, let's create two concrete classes: `Dog` and `Cat`. Each of these classes must implement the `eat()`, `sleep()`, and `make_sound()` methods:

```
class Dog(Animal):
    def eat(self):
        print("Dog is eating")

    def sleep(self):
        print("Dog is sleeping")

    def make_sound(self):
        print("Woof")

class Cat(Animal):
    def eat(self):
        print("Cat is eating")

    def sleep(self):
        print("Cat is sleeping")

    def make_sound(self):
        print("Meow")
```

Now, you can create instances of `Dog` and `Cat` and call the `eat()`, `sleep()`, and `make_sound()` methods on them:

```
d = Dog()
d.eat() # Output: "Dog is eating"
d.sleep() # Output: "Dog is sleeping"
d.make_sound() # Output: "Woof"

c = Cat()
c.eat() # Output: "Cat is eating"
c.sleep() # Output: "Cat is sleeping"
c.make_sound() # Output: "Meow"
```

Conclusion:

Abstract base classes are a powerful design pattern that can be used to enforce a common API across multiple classes. They provide a way to define a set of methods that any class inheriting from it MUST implement. In Python 3.10, you can create abstract base classes using the `abc` module. 

To use ABCs in your code, simply define an abstract base class and then create concrete classes that inherit from it. Ensure that each concrete class implements the abstract methods defined in the base class. This ensures that your code is well-structured and easy to maintain.
