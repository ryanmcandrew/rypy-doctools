model view controller design patterns
=====================================
Introduction
Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a widely-used software development design pattern that divides an application into three interconnected components, with the goal of separating the user interface, the data model, and the internal logic. This separation of concerns brings several benefits, including increased code modularity, better code maintainability, and improved code scalability. In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply the MVC pattern in Python using version 3.10.

Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, we assume you have a basic understanding of Python syntax, object-oriented programming concepts, and web development principles.

Step 1: Create the Project Structure
To get started, let's create the basic structure of our project. We'll create a new directory called "mvc_project" and inside this directory we'll create three subdirectories for each component of the MVC pattern: "models", "views" and "controllers". These directories will contain the respective Python scripts.

The project structure should look like this:

```
mvc_project/
├── controllers/
├── models/
└── views/
```

Step 2: Defining the Data Models
In this step, we will create classes in the "models" subdirectory to represent the data that the application will work with. These models should encapsulate the data and the behavior associated with it.

For example, let's create a simple "User" model that stores the user's name, email, and password. Create a new file called "user.py" in the "models" subdirectory with the following code:

```
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email, password):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.password = password

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} ({self.email})"
```

This defines a "User" class with three attributes: name, email, and password. The "__init__" function is the constructor that initializes these attributes. We also define a "__str__" method to make it easier to display the user object.

Step 3: Creating the Views
Next, we will create the "views" that will display the data and handle user interaction. In this example, we will create a simple command-line interface that allows users to create and display users.

Create a new file called "cli.py" in the "views" subdirectory with the following code:

```
class CLIView:
    def __init__(self, controller):
        self.controller = controller

    def run(self):
        while True:
            action = input("Enter command:")
            if action == "create":
                name = input("Enter name:")
                email = input("Enter email:")
                password = input("Enter password:")
                self.controller.create_user(name, email, password)
            elif action == "list":
                self.display_users()

    def display_users(self):
        users = self.controller.get_all_users()
        for user in users:
            print(user)
```

This defines a "CLIView" class that takes a "controller" object in its constructor. It provides a "run" method that contains a loop that prompts the user for commands and then calls the appropriate controller method based on the user's input. For example, if the user enters "create", the view prompts them for user information and then calls the "create_user" method on the controller. If the user enters "list", the view displays the list of all users using the "get_all_users" method of the controller.

Step 4: Defining the Controllers
In this step, we will define the "controllers" that will implement the logic of our application. They are responsible for interacting with the models and providing data to the views.

Create a new file called "user_controller.py" in the "controllers" subdirectory with the following code:

```
from models.user import User


class UserController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = []

    def create_user(self, name, email, password):
        user = User(name, email, password)
        self.users.append(user)

    def get_all_users(self):
        return self.users
```

We define a "UserController" class that has two methods: "create_user" and "get_all_users". These methods interact with the "User" model to create new users and get a list of all users, respectively.

Step 5: Hooking up the Components
Now that the models, views, and controllers are defined, we need to connect them together. Create a new file called "main.py" and use it to initialize the components:

```
from models.user import User
from views.cli import CLIView
from controllers.user_controller import UserController


user_controller = UserController()
cli_view = CLIView(user_controller)

cli_view.run()
```

We create an instance of the "UserController" and "CLIView" classes and pass the controller to the view's constructor. We then call the "run" method on the view to start the application.

Step 6: Test the Application
To test the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command on your terminal:

```
python main.py
```

This will start the application and display the prompt "Enter command:". You can then enter "create" to create a new user, or "list" to see a list of all users. When you enter "create", you will be prompted for the name, email, and password of the user you want to create. When you enter "list", all existing users will be printed.

Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to implement the Model-View-Controller design pattern in Python 3.10. By separating concerns into models, views, and controllers, we can create more efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. We created a functional command-line interface that uses a user model, a view controller, and a CLI view to create and view users. With a solid foundation in the MVC pattern, you can extend this sample implementation and build more sophisticated applications.
