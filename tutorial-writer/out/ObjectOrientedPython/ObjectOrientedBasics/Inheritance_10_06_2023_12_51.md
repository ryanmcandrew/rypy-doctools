inheritance
===========
Introduction:
Inheritance is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a class can inherit properties and methods from another class. It allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, and it helps prevent code duplication. This course will cover how to use inheritance in Python version 3.10.

What You Need:
- A computer with Python version 3.10 installed
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run Python code

Step 1: Creating a Parent Class
The first step in using inheritance is to create a parent class. A parent class is a class that other classes will inherit from. To create a parent class, create a new class using the `class` keyword and give it a name. In this example, we will create a parent class called `Animal`:

```
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def make_sound(self):
        print('The animal makes a sound.')
```

In this example, the `__init__` method initializes the name and age attributes, and the `make_sound` method prints a generic sound for the animal. Note that the `self` parameter is used in the methods to refer to the instance of the class.

Step 2: Creating a Child Class
The next step in using inheritance is to create a child class. A child class is a class that inherits from the parent class and can add its own properties and methods. To create a child class, create a new class using the `class` keyword and give it a name. In this example, we will create a child class called `Dog` that inherits from the `Animal` class:

```
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, age, breed):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.breed = breed
    
    def make_sound(self):
        print('The dog barks.')
```

In this example, the `Dog` class is created using the `Animal` class in parentheses, indicating that it inherits from the `Animal` class. The `__init__` method uses the `super()` function to call the `__init__` method of the `Animal` class and initializes the breed attribute. The `make_sound` method is overridden to print a bark for the dog.

Step 3: Using the Child Class
To use the child class, create an instance of it using the class name, and call its methods. In this example, we will create an instance of the `Dog` class and call its `make_sound` method:

```
my_dog = Dog('Fido', 3, 'Labrador')
my_dog.make_sound()
```

This will output `The dog barks.` since it is the `make_sound` method of the `Dog` class that is being called.

Step 4: Overriding Parent Methods
When a child class inherits from a parent class, it can override the parent's methods. To override a method, simply define a method with the same name in the child class. In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the `make_sound` method of the `Animal` class:

```
def make_sound(self):
    print('The dog barks.')
```

When an instance of the child class calls the overridden method, it will execute the method of the child class instead of the parent class.

Step 5: Using Super() to call Parent Methods
If a child class overrides a method in the parent class but still wants to use the functionality of the parent's method, it can use the `super()` function to call the parent's method. In this example, the `Dog` class calls the `make_sound` method of the `Animal` class and then prints the word "bark" on a new line:

```
def make_sound(self):
    super().make_sound()
    print('bark')
```

When `my_dog.make_sound()` is called, it will output `The animal makes a sound.` on the first line and `bark` on the second line.

Conclusion:
Inheritance is a fundamental technique in Object-Oriented Programming that enables hierarchical relationships between classes and prevents code duplication. In Python version 3.10, creating a parent class, creating a child class, and using the child class are accomplished using the familiar `class` keyword and inheritance syntax. Child classes can override parent methods and use the `super()` function to call the parent's method.
