dictionaries
============
Lesson 1: Introduction to Dictionaries
- Explain what dictionaries are and how they work.
- Show examples of what dictionaries look like in Python.
- Explain the concept of a key-value pair.

Lesson 2: Creating Dictionaries
- Show how to create dictionaries using curly braces {} and separating key-value pairs with a colon.
- Explain how to add, modify, and delete key-value pairs in dictionaries.
- Demonstrate how to create nested dictionaries.

Lesson 3: Accessing and Manipulating Dictionaries
- Explain how to access values in dictionaries using keys.
- Demonstrate how to use the .keys(), .values(), and .items() methods of dictionaries.
- Show how to iterate through dictionaries using loops.

Lesson 4: Advanced Dictionary Techniques
- Explain how to use the .get() method in dictionaries to avoid KeyError.
- Show how to use the defaultdict class to provide a default value for missing keys.
- Explain how to use the Counter class to count the frequency of items in a list.

Lesson 5: Applications of Dictionaries
- Show how to use dictionaries to create word frequency counters.
- Demonstrate how to use dictionaries to group items by category.
- Explain how to use dictionaries to modify data in JSON and CSV files.

Lesson 6: Best Practices for Using Dictionaries
- Explain the importance of choosing meaningful keys for dictionaries.
- Show how to use list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions to create dictionaries efficiently.
- Demonstrate how to use the copy() method to create a copy of a dictionary.
- Discuss the pros and cons of using dictionaries vs. lists in different scenarios.

Final Project:
- Create a program that uses dictionaries to store and manipulate data.
- Explain the design choices you made for the dictionary structure and key names.
- Demonstrate how the program can be used for a real-world task.
